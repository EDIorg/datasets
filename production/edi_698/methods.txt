This data set is a compilation of long-term data on 412 lakes from multiple data sources including researchers at universities, state and federal agencies, and other publicly available data sources (see data provenance). Because this is a compilation of data sets from many contributors, methodologies for data collection were variable across lake data sets for each parameter. Temperature and DO data are supplied as received from the data providers. QA/QC was completed on these profiles interpolated from the raw data as follows: Impossible values were first removed, which were defined as those less than 0 or greater than 40 for both temperature (degreesCelsius) and DO (milligramsPerLiter). Profiles were removed from further processing if this either removed greater than 95% of a profile or left less than three measurement depths in a profile. Some profiles lacked a 0 depth point. Prior to interpolation, this was added by 1) changing the minimum depth to 0 if it was less than 0.5 m, 2) adding a 0 depth point and assigning temperature and DO values equal to the shallowest available depth if it was greater than 0.5 m but less than or equal to 3 m deep, 3) if the minimum depth exceeded 3 m the profile was excluded from interpolation. Profiles were interpolated from 0 m to the deepest point at 0.5 m intervals using the pchip function of the pracma R package. 

Further information on lake characteristics, water clarity, chlorophyll, and watershed land use are available on a subset of lakes. These ancillary water quality data were not extensively quality checked; it is up to the user to screen for erroneous data points.
