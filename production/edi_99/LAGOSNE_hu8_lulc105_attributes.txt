hu8_tri_mean		meter	real		mean terrain ruggedness index (TRI) of cells within the zone, where TRI at each cell is the absolute difference in meters between the elevation of the focal cell and its immediate neighbors (the cell size is 10 m square).	numeric	0.06	2.3		
hu8_tri_std		meter	real		standard deviation of the terrain ruggedness index (TRI) of cells within the zone, where TRI at each cell is the absolute difference in meters between the elevation of the focal cell and its immediate neighbors (the cell size is 10 m square).	numeric	0.09	1.5
