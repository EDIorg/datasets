Primary producers were sampled by species throughout the year, at green up (March, May, and September), when flowering (May and September/October), and when going to seed (May/June and September/October). Plants were collected from each of the trapping webs in the cardinal directions (spokes 1, 4, 7, and 10). A minimum of ten samples from each functional type were collected from both trapping webs, along four spokes in the cardinal directions. Samples were placed in coin envelopes in the field and then placed in a 40 degrees C drying oven for 48 hours in the laboratory. We collected leaves and seeds for delta13C and delta15N isotopic analysis as well as percent carbon and nitrogen by weight and C:N ratios to establish a baseline of variation in nitrogen between tissue types and across time for comparison with plasma values. Plant species with high relative abundance were selected for analysis (http://sev.lternet.edu/data/sev-129). Plants were collected from the trapping webs
