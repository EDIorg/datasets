Study	"Whether the seedling came from the first pot experiment, conducted in 2013, or the second pot experiment, conducted in 2015"	categorical				
Spatial_block_of_pot	"In both studies, pots were arranged in spatial blocks, with pots of each treatment level spatially clustered"	character				
Replicate	Pot in first (2013) experiment or spatial cluster in second (2015) experiment	character				
Position_within_pot_or_block	"In first (2013) experiment, indicates cardinal direction of seedling from buffel grass within a pot; in second (2015) experiment it designates whether the pot within the spatial block received a buffel grass or no competitor"	categorical				
Radius_from_buffel_adult	"In first (2013) experiment, it refers to which concentric ring around buffel grass adult seedling was in; in second experiment seedlings were one per pot, so all values are 0 because it is not a factor. Value of 1-4 for four concentric rings of seedlings in first experiment"	character				
Treatment_level	Whether palo verde seedling had been grown in a pot with or without buffel grass	categorical				
delta_13_C	"Ratio of C13 to C12 within palo verde seedling tissue, normalized and compared with atmospheric values"	numeric	dimensionless		NA	not available
delta_15_N	"Ratio of N15 to N14 within palo verde seedling tissue, normalized and compared with atmospheric values"	numeric	dimensionless
