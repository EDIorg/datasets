Germinated	Whether or not the scarified palo verde seed planted in a given pot germinated	categorical				
Survived_to_experiment_end	Whether or not the focal palo verde seedling in a given pot survived to the end of the experiment	categorical				
Block_in_greenhouse	"Pots were arranged in spatial blocks, with pots of each treatment level spatially clustered"	character				
Side_of_table	"Whether the block of pots was on the south or north side of the table in the greenhouse, which received slightly different amounts of light"	categorical				
Row_on_table	Row within each spatial block	categorical				
Role_in_experiment	"Variable group seedlings by whether they were involved in a buffel grass impact on palo verde, a conspecific impact on palo verde, or a control with no seedling impacting the palo verde"	categorical				
Role	The experiment was initially set up to test whether leachate from conspecifics or from buffel grass limited the growth of palo verde seedlings due to allelopathy	categorical				
Seedling_species	Species of seedling	categorical				
Focal	Whether this seedling was the focal individual for measuring impact of the other within the experiment	categorical				
Mg_dry_wt_at_experiment_end	Milligrams of biomass measured for the total seedling after drying in a drying oven	numeric	milligram		NA	not available
Species_of_impact	Whether the non-focal seedling either donating drained leachate to or in the pot competing with the focal seedling was palo verde or buffel grass or just bare soil (no seedling)	categorical				
Type_of_impact	The experiment was initially set up to test whether leachate from conspecifics or from buffel grass limited the growth of palo verde seedlings due to allelopathy	categorical
