We quantified atmospheric N deposition using ion exchange resin tube collectors (Fenn et al. 2003, Wieder et al. 2016b), filled with mixed bed cation/anion exchange resin (Amberlite IRN 150) that had been rinsed with deionized water prior to deployment in the field.  We placed five collectors in the open and five beneath clumps of <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis> trees (throughfall).  In addition, 2 resin tubes, sealed at the top, and placed in the field within PVC sleeves, served as blank controls.  A plastic funnel with a collection area of 400 cm<superscript>2</superscript> channeled precipitation into the resin tubes.  We collected and replaced tubes in mid-May and mid-October.  For the October-May periods, we affixed a 1-m extension tube to each collection funnel to capture snowfall, which upon melt would drain into the resin tubes.

We extracted retrieved resins with 1 M KI and analyzed the extract solutions for NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N (phenate method) on a Seal AA3 AutoAnalyzer and for NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N by ion chromatography (Dionex ICS 1500).  We subtracted volume-weighted concentrations in blank resin tube extracts from concentrations in extracts from exposed resin tubes and corrected deposition values for laboratory-determined extraction efficiencies (96.9 and 98.2 % for NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N and NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N, respectively; Wieder et al. 2016b).
