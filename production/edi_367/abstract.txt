Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>; regional background levels <2 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>.  Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition.  To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH<subscript>4</subscript>NO<subscript>3</subscript>) to a bog near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, plus controls (no water or N addition). Resin tubes filled with mixed-bed ion exchange resin were swapped in and out at each collection/deployment date (mid-May and mid-October of each year). Upon collection, resins were extracted with 1M KI and analyzed for inorganic N concentrations. Deposition of NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N, NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N, and DIN averaged 187 &#177; 11, 237 &#177; 13, and 426 &#177; 19 &mu;g m<superscript>-2</superscript> da<superscript>-1</superscript>, corresponding to 0.68 &#177; 0.04, 0.87 &#177; 0.05, and 1.55 &#177; 0.07 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, with no significant differences between open and throughfall collectors for any of the three measured parameters (p >= 0.63).  Deposition of NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N was significantly higher during the growing season (averaging 240 &mu;g m<superscript>-2</superscript> da<superscript>-1</superscript>) than during the winter months (averaging 121 &mu;g m<superscript>-2</superscript> da<superscript>-1</superscript>) (p = 0.0004), while NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N and DIN deposition did not differ significantly between winter and summer (p = 0.06 and 0.13, respectively).
