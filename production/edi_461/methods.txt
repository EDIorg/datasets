We constructed two complexes of "experimental" ("constructed") pools (N=256) in early December 1999.  Experimental pools had the same soils as reference pools (Antioch San Ysidro complex and San Ysidro sandy loam), were similar in elevation, had relatively level topography (0-2% slopes), likely supported vernal pools historically, and were in close proximity to reference pools. Experimental pools were designed to mimic reference pools in five physical dimensions: 1) size, 2) shape, 3) slope, 4) maximum depth, and 5) topography of intervening grassland habitat. Experimental pools range in distance from 15 to 150 m from reference pools, and each pool is 10 m from the nearest experimental pool, a typical distance between reference pools at this study site. Vernal pool plant species typically have limited dispersal abilities, so the scale of our design is appropriate for exploring how early colonization events shape these plant communities. 

Because seasonal inundation is a defining property of vernal pools, we characterized winter flooding of pools at the study site during five of the eighteen wet seasons. Limited financial resources precluded measurements in additional years of the study. At weekly intervals during the wet season, we recorded standing water in all experimental pools and in a subset of the reference pools for 10-15 weeks. We calculated the duration of inundation (number of days inundated) for each pool, and recorded the depth of water at the center and at seed-plot locations in experimental pools, in the center of reference pools, and in 1-3 sampling quadrats per reference pool. 

We measured plant occurrence in experimental pools during the flowering phase (April-May) each year from 2000 to 2017. We placed a square frame (0.50 m x 0.50 m = 0.25 m2) divided into 100 subquadrats (each 5 cm x 5 cm) over the permanently marked plot in each pool and recorded the number of individuals of each of the five focal species (these were species that were seeded into the pools as part of the experiment), as well as the frequency (number of subquadrats out of 100 in which the species occurred) of all species present within each marked plot in each year. Plants were identified to species using Hickman (1993), and a voucher collection is maintained in the Collinge laboratory at CU-Boulder.

2014, 24-Apr, N = 7

2015, 21-Apr, N = 10

2016, 21-Apr, N = 10, SUB1 AND SUB2 ARE TWO SUBSTITUTE POOLS SAMPLED TO REPRESENT REFERENCE POOLS SINCE PLOT MARKERS COULDN'T BE FOUND.

2017, 24-Apr, N = 11, NOTE THAT IN 2017, THESE TEN POOLS WERE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT SIMILAR CONDITIONS AS CONSTRUCTED POOLS, BUT WERE NOT THE SAME POOLS CHOSEN TO SAMPLE IN PREVIOUS YEARS BECAUSE PLOT MARKERS COULD NOT BE FOUND. UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS WERE GIVE SO AS TO NOT HAVE POOLS GIVEN THE SAME NUMBER.


Notes for water depth sampling of constructed pools

2000	14 January to 30 March are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2000

2002	20 DECEMBER to 11 APRIL are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2001/2002

2009	26 January to 19 March are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2009

2010	24 January to 16 APRIL are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2010

2010	NOTE THAT DEPTHS WERE TAKEN ONLY AT SEED PLOTS, NOT AT POOL CENTERS IN 2010

2011	21 December 2010 to 15 April 2011 are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2010-2011.

2011	NOTE THAT DEPTHS WERE TAKEN ONLY AT SEED PLOTS, NOT AT POOL CENTERS IN 2010-2011.

2012	27 January to 22 APRIL are dates of observable water in at least some of the pools in 2012

2012	NOTE THAT DEPTHS WERE TAKEN ONLY AT SEED PLOTS, NOT AT POOL CENTERS IN 2012

2012	NOTE: There was a 4-week gap in the data from 2/17/12 to 3/16/12; no depths were measured during this time
