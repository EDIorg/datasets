Snowshoe hares were trapped during the summer (May-August) 1998-2018 using live-traps (51x18x18 cm, Tomahawk Live Trap Company, Tomahawk, WI) baited with alfalfa cubes and apples, spaced approximately 50m apart. Each of the seven Seeley Lake hare trapping grids consisted of approximately 50 traps, while the nine Tally Lake trapping grids had approximately 80 traps each. Each grid was trapped for 3-5 days each summer, ensuring population closure. We marked all hares  greater than 500g with a unique numbered ear tag. We weighed all hares, determined sex, measured right hind foot length and determined breeding status (lactating or pregnant, testes abdominal or testes scrotal). We also collected ear tissue samples of some hares with a biopsy punch. All capture and handling procedures were approved by the University of Montana Animal Care and Use Committee.
