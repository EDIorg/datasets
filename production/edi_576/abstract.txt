These data were collected over 21 years from 1998-2018 with trapping primarily occurring from May-August. Snowshoe hares were trapped at 16 different girds spread across two regions (Tally Lake and Seeley Lake). Seeley Lake (Lat. = 47.2degree, Long. = -113.4degree) and Tally Lake (Lat. = 48.5degree, Long. = -114.8degree) are approximately 175 km apart and span similar elevations (approximately 1500-1900 m.a.s.l.). Both areas are managed by the US Forest Service (USFS) with a history of multiple use including timber production and are dominated by moist, coniferous forests of Douglas fir, western larch, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce and Ponderosa pine with a herbaceous understory. Snowshoe hares were trapped during the summer using live-traps. We marked all hares  greater than 500g with a unique numbered ear tag. We weighed all hares, determined sex, measured right hind foot (RHF) length and determined breeding status. Only adult hares (weight  greater than  700g and RHF  greater than  10cm) are included in this dataset.
