Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>; regional background levels <2 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>.  Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition.  To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH<subscript>4</subscript>NO<subscript>3</subscript>) to a bog near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, plus controls (no water or N addition).  We measured N<subscript>2</subscript>-fixation using the acetylene reduction technique between 2012 and 2015.  All measurements were made between June and August. Mean acetylene reduction rates ranged from 2.2 mg m<superscript>-2</superscript> da<superscript>-1</superscript> (late June 2012) to 12.3 mg m<superscript>-2</superscript> da<superscript>-1</superscript> (late July 2014).  Averaged across all measurement dates, rates were highest in the 5 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript> treatment, and decreased with increasing N loading.  The acetylene reduction/N2 fixation response to N addition was described by a segmented linear regression, with rates increasing as N addition increased to 3.1 &#177; 1.5 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript> and decreasing with further increases in N addition.  Water addition alone had no significant effect on N fixation rates on any of the measurement dates (p >= 0.79). While increasing N deposition may not substantively change total inputs of new N to bogs, the form on new N inputs shifts to inorganic N in deposition, rather than organic N produced by the microorganisms that are fixing N<subscript>2</subscript>.
