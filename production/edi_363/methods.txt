We measured N<subscript>2</subscript>-fixation using the acetylene reduction technique with field modifications.  At the beginning of each field season, we collected one core of Sphagnum fuscum, approximately 8 cm deep and 7 cm in diameter in each plot, wrapped each core in mesh screening, and placed cores into the peat, allowing for repeated measurements over a growing season.  We measured N<subscript>2</subscript>-fixation in these cores 6 times in 2012, 5 times in 2013, 2 times in 2014, and 2 times in 2015, with all measurements taken between June and August.  For incubations, we weighed the moss cores, placed them upside down in gas-tight 500 mL glass Mason jars with attached stopcocks, injected 20 mL of acetylene, and returned the jars to the surface peat for 24 hours with the bottom of the jar facing upward to expose the moss capitula to sunlight.  Using 10 mL syringes with stopcocks, we collected headspace samples at the beginning and end of each 24-hr incubation period; linearity of ethylene production over time was established previously. After each incubation, we removed the cores from the Mason jars and returned them to their original locations in the peat. 

We analyzed headspace samples for ethylene concentrations in the laboratory at the Meanook Biological Research Station (2012-2013) and at Athabasca University (2014-2015) using a Shimadzu 2014 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and HaySep T column with He as the carrier gas and with the following temperature settings: detector 175 C, injector 125 C, and column 100 C.  Blank incubations (-moss, + C<subscript>2</subscript>H<subscript>2</subscript>) yielded consistently low C<subscript>2</subscript>H<subscript>2</subscript> concentrations (<5 ppm) and there was no background C<subscript>2</subscript>H<subscript>2</subscript> production in control incubations (+moss, - C<subscript>2</subscript>H<subscript>2</subscript>).  To convert ethylene production rates to N<subscript>2</subscript>-fixation rates, we used a conversion factor of 0.29 moles of ethylene produced per mole of N<subscript>2</subscript> fixed, based on previous N<subscript>2</subscript>-fixation measurements in <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> moss cores in Alberta bogs.
