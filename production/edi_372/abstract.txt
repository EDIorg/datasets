Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>; regional background levels <2 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>.  Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition.  To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH<subscript>4</subscript>NO<subscript>3</subscript>) to a bog near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, plus controls (no water or N addition). Data collected of the growing season using the crank wire method allowed for the calculation of NPP.  Tissues were also collected and analyzed on Leco TruSpec CN analyzer.  Increasing N addition had no effect on <emphasis>Sphagnum fuscum</emphasis> NPP in year 1, but inhibited <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> NPP in years 2-5, with capitula N concentrations remaining consistent across all years, but with stem N concentrations increasing with N input. The decrease in <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> NPP with increasing N addition that we report for Mariana Lakes Bog has implications for peat accumulation in bogs.
