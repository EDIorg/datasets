Net primary production (NPP) of <emphasis>Sphagnum fuscum</emphasis> is the product of linear growth of stems (cm yr<superscript>-1</superscript>) and stem mass density (SMD), with SMD defined as the mass of 1-cm lengths of <emphasis>Sphagnum</emphasis> stems beneath the capitula per m<superscript>2</superscript>.  We measured linear growth using the cranked wire method (Clymo 1970).  We set 30 cranked wires in each of the 21 study plots, with all wires placed in hummocks dominated by <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis>.  Each year, from 2011 through 2015, we set cranked wires in May after the surface peat had thawed, and remeasured them at the end of the growing season (in late September or early October). 

To measure SMD, we collected surface cores (6.5 cm diam.) from <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> hummocks in each plot between July 7th and 10th of each year.  From each core, we removed and counted all capitula to determine <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> plant density (individual plants m<superscript>-2</superscript>).  We separated 70 stems of <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis>, cut them into 2-cm lengths, and weighed them after drying at 55 C for 5 days.  These weights divided by 2 and again by 70 represent the average mass of a 1-cm stem of an individual <emphasis>Sphagnum</emphasis> plant; this value was multiplied by plant density to yield SMD.  

From cores collected in early July and early October from 2013 through 2015, we calculated capitulum mass density (CMD) (g m<superscript>-2</superscript>) as the dry mass of all capitula from a core, scaled up to a m<superscript>2</superscript> basis.  Capitula and stems were dried, homogenized in a Thomas Wiley Mini-Mill, and analyzed for N concentration on a Flash EA 1112 Series CN Soil Analyzer.

We calculated the amount of N annually utilized by <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> to satisfy NPP requirements (g N m<superscript>-2</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>) as the product of <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> NPP and the N concentration in the 0-2 cm stem sections.  For both summer and fall collections, we calculated the quantity of N stored in <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> capitula (g N m<superscript>-2</superscript>) as the product of CMD and N concentration in the capitula.
