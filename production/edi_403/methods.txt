The multiparameter sondes were deployed over the deep point at each lake at 0.5 m depth. The sensors took measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentration every 30 minutes. The measurements were then averaged to a daily value using all measurements between 12:00 and 23:59 for each parameter. The multiparameter sondes were YSI EXO2s (Xylem, Inc) in 2014 and 2015 and YSI EXO3s (Xylem, Inc) in 2018. The sensors were calibrated monthly in 2014 and 2015 and when indicated by the sensor software in 2018.
