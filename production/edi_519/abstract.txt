We incubated 10 forest soils (collected from sites across North America, including the Luquillo LTER/CZO) in the laboratory for over two years to quantify the decomposition of carbon derived from added litter and lignin, as well as from extant soil organic matter. Each soil was subjected to two substrate addition treatments: a) litter derived from a C4 grass precipitated with 13C-enriched lignin, or the same C4 grass litter was precipitated with natural-abundance lignin. The concentrations and delta13C composition of carbon dioxide produced from each soil were measured periodically over time and partitioned into sources (soil organic matter, litter, and added lignin) using isotope mixing models. The methods and results are described in detail by a manuscript in Ecology (Hall et al., 2020).
