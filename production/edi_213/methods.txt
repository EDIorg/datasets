Sampling methods: We sampled vegetation in nine12- 20 km long study reaches.  Reaches were chosen to be well distributed geographically; to avoid reservoirs, dams, and extensive area of urban river bank development; and to contain abundant, regularly flooded forest.  In larger forest patches (at least 1.2 km wide), five sampling points were located at 125-m intervals along randomly established transects perpendicular to the main channel.  Sampling points (usually one to three) were located at random in smaller forest patches and always separated by at least 125 m.  We attempted to sample across the range of conditions (elevation, distance from river, patch size, past land use) that occurred throughout the floodplain, but we only sampled areas that were currently in forest cover. During summers of 1999 - 2001, we placed 10m x 20m sample plots (n=556). Each plot was located using a global positioning system. We recorded whether the site was leveed or unleeved, and the location of the plot relative to the levee.  All trees â‰¥ 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were identified to species and the DBH recorded.
