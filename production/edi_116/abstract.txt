Streams and rivers emit petagrams of CO2 yet there is little known about how discharge (Q) variability impacts stream CO2 at broad scales. Herein, we compiled historical water quality (including pH, alkalinity and temperature) measurements for conterminous USGS sites and coupled them with daily Q for this analysis (the water_quality.csv dataset, 10,822 sites). Based on this dataset, NHDplus channel slopes (NHDplus_slopeSO.csv, 24,764 sites) and hydraulic geometry equations (lm_vQ.csv, 12,854 sites), we calculated partial pressure of dissolved CO2 (pCO2), gas transfer velocity (k) and CO2 effluxes (F) for a total of 813 USGS sites across conterminous US. We derived hydrologic responses (log-linear regressions) for pCO2, k and F versus Q at each site and explored how these responses varied across stream order and different regions. Ancillary datasets provided coordinates (coor_sites.xls), hydrologic unit code (HUC.csv), and watershed area of conterminous USGS sites (watersheds_area.csv).
