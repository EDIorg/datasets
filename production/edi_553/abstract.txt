It was created to determine how much food is discarded in the U.S., and to determine if specific factors drive increased disposal. By applying meta-analytic tools on it this dataset, it was found that the aggregate proportion of food waste in U.S. municipal solid waste from 1995 to 2013 was 0.147 (95% CI 0.137â€“0.157) of total disposed waste, which is lower than that estimated by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the same period (0.176). Further, that the proportion of food waste increased significantly with time, and there were no significant differences in food waste between rural and urban samples, or between commercial/institutional and residential samples. These results are published in the study titled Quantification of Food Waste Disposal in the United States: A Meta-Analysis (Thyberg et al., 2015).
