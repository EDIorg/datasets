Asian pheretimoid earthworms of the genera Amynthas and Metaphire (jumping worms) are leading a new wave of co-invasion into Northeastern and Midwestern states, with potential consequences for native organisms and ecosystem processes. However, little is known about their distribution, abundance, and habitat preferences in urban landscapes â€“ areas which likely influence range expansion via human-driven spread. We led a participatory field campaign to assess jumping worm distribution and abundance in Madison, Wisconsin in September of 2017. By compressing 250 person-hours of sampling effort into a single day, we quantified presence and abundance of three jumping worm species across different land-cover types (forest, grassland, open space, residential lawns and gardens), finding that urban green spaces differed in invasibility. We show that community science can be powerful for researching invasive species while engaging the public in conservation. This approach was particularly effective here, where broad spatial sampling was required within a short temporal window.
