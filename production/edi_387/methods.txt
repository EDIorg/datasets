At each study site, teams visually surveyed the area for signs of jumping worm presence, including live organisms or the characteristic granular soil signature indicative of their activity. For example, in a residential yard, participants would walk through the space for approximately 10 minutes, brushing aside leaf litter and checking underneath planters or landscaping cloth (where the species are anecdotally known to congregate) for live earthworms, and examining garden soil for structural characteristics. Next, earthworms were censused at three haphazard locations using a 30cm x 30cm quadrat and a standard mustard extraction (Lawrence and Bowers 2002). Any suspected jumping worms found were collected and returned to the laboratory for visual identification following the field campaign. We identified jumping worms to species (A. tokioensis, A. agrestis, M. hilgendorfi) when possible (Chang et al. 2016a). Participants also recorded the presence/absence of any additional (European) earthworm species observed during sampling.
