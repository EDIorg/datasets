We deployed HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 loggers at 11 locations (9 streams - 2 streams had dataloggers placed in different reaches) in the upper Little Tennessee and upper Chattooga River watersheds, Macon County, North Carolina, U.S.A. Prior to deployment, all loggers were placed in a bucket of water overnight to ensure that the loggers were working properly and were calibrated properly. Loggers were programmed to collect stream temperature data at 10 minute intervals. Data loggers were attached to the side of a brick and fully immersed in the stream, with the capped front of the logger facing upstream. When possible, the logger was placed in a deeper part of the stream and in the shade. GPS locations of the loggers were collected using a Garmin GPSmap 62s receiver (WGS84). After approximately 300 days, data from the units were downloaded using the HOBO Waterproof Shuttle and HOBOware software. Data were QA/QC'd by graphing the data in HOBOware and visually assessing for anomalies. Outliers and spikes in temperature were removed and noted in comments. Noteworthy field observations (e.g., data logger buried in sand) were also included in comments. Files were saved as CSV.
