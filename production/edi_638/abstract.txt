We used HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 loggers to measure stream temperature at 10 minute intervals in 9 1st, 2nd and 3rd order streams in the upper Little Tennessee and Chattooga River watersheds, Macon County, North Carolina, U.S.A. The dataloggers were deployed in January and February 2020. Data collections are ongoing. Stream temperature data will be used to help assess the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., removal of riparian vegetation and artificial ponds) on stream temperature in these smaller headwater streams.
