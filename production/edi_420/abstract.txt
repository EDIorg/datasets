Weekly spatial measurements of chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids from a multiparameter handheld sonde in 65 meter grid across the entire lake during an ice-free algal bloom. While sonde measurements were being recorded macrophyte presence was also documented. Spatial measurements where made in Swan Lake in Iowa, USA during 2018. Spatial data are unaltered from data collection from sonde. These data were used to test for spatial heterogeneity during, before, and after a harmful algal bloom.
