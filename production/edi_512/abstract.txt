These datafiles contain the plant-pollinator interaction data collected by Paul CaraDonna et al. at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, CO, USA during the 2013, 2014 and 2015 growing season. These data were collected to investigate temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions; specifically, these data were collected in a manner to allow for the construction of weekly plant-pollinator interaction networks in order to investigate fine scale temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions. The data represent extensive community-wide field observations of animal pollinators visiting flowering plants in a subalpine ecosystem for the majority of the summer growing season (May–September).
