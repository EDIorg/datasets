year	"The year column refers the year of study. Plant-pollinator interaction sampling was conducted in three years: 2013, 2014, and 2015. Data type: integers; values can be 2013, 2014 or 2015."	numeric	nominalYear			
site	The site column refers to the specific meadow site that the observations were conducted within. There were two meadow sites: Shady Point and Twin Meadows. These are reported as shady_point and twin_meadows respectively. Data type: factor	categorical				
plant	"The plant column refers to the plant species whose flowers were observed and counted within each transect. Values are plant species names reported as genus_species, e.g., Claytonia lanceolata = claytonia_lanceolata. Data type: factor."	character				
transect	The transect column refers to the specific transect flowers were counted within. At each of the two sites there we established four 25 x 1 m transects to monitor flowering abundance and phenology each week to coincide with plant-pollinator interaction sampling in the same meadows. Datatype: integers. Dataset range = 1–4.	character				
week_num	"The week_num column refers to the sampling week that a 15-minute observation period occurred within. A value of 1 refers to the first week of sampling. Data type: integer, dataset value range 1–16."	numeric	number		NA	not available
flower_count	"The flower_count column refers to the number of counted flowers for each species within each transect at each site in each year. All flowering plants observed across the entire period of study are included; therefore, many species have a count = 0 in most weeks, since they were present in the study, but did not have flowers in every week of study. Data type: integer. Measurement unit is the number (count) of flowers for each plant species."	numeric	number		NA	not available
