aspen presence and persistence- During summer 2012, we resampled 72 widely distributed 0.25-ha permanent plots in lodgepole pine forests that burned in 1988 as stand-replacing fire. These plots were established and sampled in 1999 (Turner et al., 2004), and we followed the same sampling protocols. Briefly, we tallied the number of postfire aspen and conifers by species in three parallel 50-m 2-m belt transects oriented due north and separated by 25 m. Additionally, we recorded the basal diameter of 25 lodgepole pines. 

Aspen size-During summer 2013, we resampled 21 smaller permanent plots (Romme et al., 2005) . Plots were established in 1996 and were of variable size to encompass at least 10 aspen seedlings. Aspen height and basal diameter, evidence of ungulate browsing, and local lodgepole pine density had previously been measured in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2000 (see Romme et al., 2005), and we followed the same protocols. Briefly, we sampled along a transect of 10–20 m in length, measuring aspen size on both sides and counting lodgepole pines within a 2–4-m belt (depending on stand density). We examined leaders and branches for browsed buds and twigs to determine percent of individuals browsed. Three mineral soil samples were collected using a 15- cm long PVC corer. Soils were sieved, composited by site, and oven dried at 60 C to constant mass. Soils were analyzed for % total soil nitrogen (N) (micro Kjeldhal procedure), soil pH (measured in water), % organic matter (determined using dry combustion), and available phosphorous (Bray P1 extract) by the University of Wisconsin Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory, Madison, WI, USA (UW SPAL, 2013).

Aspen above and below ground biomass- To estimate current above- and belowground biomass ratios, in summer 2014, we excavated 10 aspen at six plots (approximately two aspen per plot) using hand tools. Although a sample size of 10 is small, it was logistically infeasible to harvest additional trees. Plots spanned a range of lodgepole pine densities (500–33,000 lodgepole pine ha-1) tallied along a 20-m 4-m belt transect. At each site, we selected one or two of the largest aspen individuals, separated by at least 15 m. We first measured height and basal diameter of the dominant stem. We then excavated all lateral and sinker roots until they were too small to follow (2-mm diameter). We measured the length of each lateral root, counted all ramets that emerged from each lateral root, and recorded their height and basal diameter. All biomass was harvested and separated into three components: aboveground woody biomass, leaves, and belowground biomass. Biomass was dried at 70 C to constant mass and dry mass was recorded. Cross sections from each dominant stem were collected to determine stem ages. Stem cross sections were finely sanded (400 grit) and tree rings were counted with a microscope.
