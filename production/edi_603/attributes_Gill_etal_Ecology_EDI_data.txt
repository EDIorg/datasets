Cones_per_tree	"Mean number of cones per live, cone-bearing tree, measured categorically at nearest live, cone-bearing tree every 2 m along 50-m live edge transect, with each tree classified as having <10, 10-50, 51-100, or >100 cones per tree. For the >100 cones category, a median value of 300 was used, a conservative estimate for canopy tree P. contorta in stands >100 years old (Koch 1996). For the <10 cones per tree category, a median value of 3.7 cones per tree was assigned, as calculated for 15-yr old P. contorta forest in the GYE by Turner et al. (2007)."	numeric	numberPerTree		NA	not available

NumberTrays	"Number of 0.28 x 0.54 x 0.06-m trays comprising the “trap” at distance interval. Starting at the live forest edge, two trays were placed at 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-m intervals along each transect. Four trays were placed at 50 m along each transect and eight trays were placed at 100 m to account for decreased likelihood of capturing seeds at greater distances (Nathan, Safriel, Noy-Meir, & Schiller, 2000)."	numeric	number		NA	not available
