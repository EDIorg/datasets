These data were collected by NS Gill, TJ Hoecker, and MG Turner in Grand Teton National Park from July-October 2018. The dataset represents seed delivery and surrounding forest structure and demographics following the 2016 Berry Fire, used to examine the relationship between fire regime change and conifer seed delivery in Pinus contorta var. latifolia forests. Stand structure and cone abundance were quantified at 21 sites positioned at the edges of the burned area in 50-m transects. Seed delivery was measured in seed traps placed at distance intervals running out to 100 m into burned patches from the live forest edge over a period of three months. Pinus contorta, Picea engelmannii, and Abies lasiocarpa seeds were collected. Five meteorological stations were deployed throughout the study area. Wind speed and direction data were attributed to transects from the nearest of these deployed meteorological stations.
