Stand structure and cone abundance were measured along 50-m live edge transects (n = 18) stratified by age of the live forest (18-yr-old [n = 5], 30-yr-old [n = 6], and  greater than 100-yr-old [n = 7]) at the edge of the burn, running 5 m inside (and parallel to) the live forest edge. Every 2 m along live transects, the species, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and cone abundance category of the nearest live, cone-bearing tree was recorded (n = 25). Cone quantities were classified as  less than 10, 10-50, 51-100, or  greater than 100 cones per tree. For later quantitative analysis, cone count categories were assigned median values. For the  greater than 100 cones per tree category, a median value of 300 cones was selected, a conservative estimate for canopy trees in P. contorta stands  greater than 100 years old (Koch, 1996). For the  less than 10 cones per tree category, a median value of 3.7 cones per tree was assigned, as calculated for 15-yr old Pinus contorta forest in the GYE by (Turner, Turner, Romme, & Tinker, 2007). The number of live, cone-bearing trees within 1 m of the transect was tallied by species. Serotiny was recorded at each edge by the percent of live, cone-bearing trees that held at least one serotinous cone.

Seed delivery into burned patches was measured along 100-m burned transects (n = 18), each running perpendicular to a live edge transect and into the burned patch, far from any  live, cone-bearing trees within the burned patch. Transects were separated by a minimum distance of 150 m. Within each age class, transects were located to capture variation in topographic position and direction relative to prevailing winds. Seed delivery was measured over three months using 0.28 x 0.54-m trays (6.20 cm deep) placed in July 2018 (n = 24 trays per site) and collected in October 2018. Trays were covered by 0.635 cm2 grain hardware cloth, large enough to allow conifer seeds to enter but fine enough to prevent seed removal by birds and rodents. Landscaping fabric was placed in the bottom of trays to retain seeds while allowing water to drain from slits in tray bottoms. Trays were secured in place with landscape staples. Starting at the live forest edge, two trays were placed at 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-m intervals along each transect. Four trays were placed at 50 m along each transect and eight trays were placed at 100 m to account for decreased likelihood of capturing seeds at greater distances (Nathan, Safriel, Noy-Meir, & Schiller, 2000). The number of standing dead trees (snags) within 1 m of transects was measured over the first 50 m to estimate snag density. The slope of each transect was recorded using a clinometer.

Wind speed and direction data were recorded at 30-minute intervals over the three and a half months of seed trapping using METER Environment meteorological stations (n = 5) distributed throughout the study area. Wind data from the nearest station were attributed to each burned transect (in all cases, transects were within 2.7 km of the nearest wind station).
