We measured root biomass in the top 30 cm of peat in 2014. On 31 May 2014, we extracted two 7.6-cm diam. cores to a depth of 30 cm in each plot using a section of PVC pipe fitted with a sharpened metal cylindrical tip.  We manually extracted roots from cores divided into two 15-cm sections using tweezers by submerging each section in a shallow dish filled with water to help tease the roots apart.To quantify root production, we used the ingrowth bag approach (Fin&eacute;r and Laine 2000).  On 1 June 2014, we inserted two tulle bags (7.6 cm diam.; 30 cm tall) filled with Premier organic peatmoss vertically into the peat in each plot.  We removed one bag on 5 October 2014 and the other on 23 September 2015, from which we calculated 1-year and 2-year root production.  Upon retrieval, we cut each of these bags into 15-cm sections, shipped them back to the laboratory, and froze them.  Due to the extreme number of fine roots throughout the 15 cm core sections, we cut the midsection of each core into a 2-cm disc using a bandsaw.  We gently boiled the discs for 30 min allowing roots to become loosened from the peat matrix.  We manually separated roots from the peat, dried them for 4 days at 55 C, and weighed them.  Previous work (Xu 2004) has shown that although root biomass in 3-cm depth increments is variable in Alberta bog peat, root biomass in the midsection of the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth increments reasonably represents root biomass across the 15-cm depth increments.
