Prevalence of five species of B/CYDV was measured in the native perennial grass Elymus glaucus, from three University of California reserves. These reserves are oak savanna habitats and have a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. To compare spatial variability in the viral community, three populations of E. glaucus were sampled at each site, and leaves from 10 plants were collected from each of the nine total populations in 2005. To compare temporal variability, leaves from 10 E. glaucus plants were collected from each of 10 replicate plots during peak biomass from 2002-2005. 

Leaf tissues from each sample was tested for B/CDYV infection using double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), with controls from closely related viruses to screen out cross-reactions.
