Protocols and Procedures

Demographic data were collected from 38,313 unique observations from a sample of 10,910 individuals of H. cumulicola, from 15 independent Florida rosemary scrub patches with different time-since-fire at Archbold Biological Station. Plants were censused during their peak of reproduction annually in July and August between 1994 and 2015. Annually, in every population, we tagged and evaluated ~100 plants. In years when < 100 plants were found, new tagged plants were added (~20-40 individuals) to the existing sample. Plants were classified into six possible stages: dead (0), alive (1), yearling (5; new plants just reaching its first census), new plant (3; plants of unknown age), missing (2), and previously dead (9). For each tagged plant, we measured maximum height (in cm), counted number of stems, and recorded reproductive status annually. We counted total number of reproductive structures (flowers and fruits) for every plant in 1994-1999, 2001, 2002, 2010-2012, and counted reproductive structures for a sample of individuals in other years. We checked the location of previously dead plants after a year of first detection to assess possible plant dormancy. Less than 0.01% of previously declared dead plants were found subsequently alive and we did not include any plant dormancy.
