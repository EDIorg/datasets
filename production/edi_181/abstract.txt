We collected demographic data from 38,313 unique observations from a sample of 10,910 individuals of H. cumulicola, from 15 independent Florida rosemary scrub patches with different time-since-fire at Archbold Biological Station, Highlands County, Florida. Plants were censused during their peak of reproduction annually in July and August between 1994 and 2015.
