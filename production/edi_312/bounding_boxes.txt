"The study was carried out in old growth forest at the La Selva Biological Station of the Organization for Tropical Studies (Heredia Province, Costa Rica).  At the juncture of the Atlantic Coastal plain and the foothills of the Cordillera Volcanica Central, elevations range from 35 m asl on the flood plain of the Rio Puerto Viejo to approximately 200 m asl along the south boundary where the preserve is contiguous with Braulio Carrillo National Park.  Topographically, La Selva varies from swamp and poorly drained soils of stream bottoms to the relatively flat aspect of alluvial terraces near the rivers in the north to rolling hills and scarped topography of weathered basaltic and andesitic lava flows toward the south.  Plots for this study were located on upland, well-drained sites only. "	-84.04676	-83.995824	10.452533	10.398498
