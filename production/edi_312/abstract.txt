Understory plants are a major contribution to the high plant species diversity of Neotropical rain forests. Shrubs, understory trees, saplings of overstory trees, and herbs occupy a habitat of generally low light levels and high humidity in which there seem to be few obvious mechanisms to support habitat partitioning. Moreover several plant families are characterized by a high number of co-occurring understory species. In 1987-1989 we sampled understory vegetation in 18 sites at the La Selva Biological Station of the Organization for Tropical Studies in Heredia Province, Costa Rica. At each site we used 20 nested quadrats to investigate the effects of soil type  on replicated sites of mapped alluvial and residual volcanic soils (5 map units) and topographic positions (ridges, midslopes and flats) on composition, density and diversity of small (1m tall to 5cm dbh, 25 m2 quadrat) and large(5-10cm dbh, 100 m2 quadrat) understory plants.  We also measured fine litter dry mass, extractable P, total organic matter, percent slope and percent incident light radiation in each quadrat.
