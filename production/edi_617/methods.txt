To measure the difference in light and temperature within canopied microsites and the open gap, Onset HOBO Temperature/Light Pendant (8K) loggers (Hoskin Scientific 2020) were placed inside and directly outside to the right of the microsites. Each pendant was tied to a plastic stake using a zip tie, recording data at 1 hour intervals. Stakes were hammered into the ground until stable with ~10 cm remaining above ground. This was done to ensure that logger data were less-influenced by ground cover and true ambient conditions both inside and in the open were recorded. Air temperature (degreeF) and light intensity (lum/ft2) were recorded hourly. Loggers were placed out mid-May and collected in mid-June to account for spring-summer seasonal variation. Hourly weather data were downloaded for the study site for the total duration of the study (Los Banos Weather Station at 37 degree 03.30  minutesN, 120 degree 51.00 minutesW, http://www.usclimatedata.com/). Date, air and soil temperature (degreeF) with solar radiation (W/m2, converted to lum/ft2) were retrieved from this climate source.
