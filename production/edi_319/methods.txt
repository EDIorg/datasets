We collected surface cores (6.5 cm diam.) from <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> hummocks in each plot in early July and early October of each year. From each core, we removed and counted all capitula to determine <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis> plant density (individual plants m<superscript>-2</superscript>) and capitulum mass density (CMD) (g m<superscript>-2</superscript>) (the dry mass of all capitula from a core, scaled up to a m<superscript>2</superscript> basis). Capitula were dried, homogenized in a Thomas Wiley Mini-Mill, and analyzed for N concentration on a Flash EA 1112 Series CN Soil Analyzer. Nitrogen concentrations were used to calculate capitulum N content on a per gram and a per meter squared basis.
