The Lake Sunapee instrumented buoy is equipped with a LICord Li19SB PAR sensor (2007-present), an air temperature sensor (HMP50 Vaisala, 2010-present), a wind speed/direction sensor (WMT50 Vaisala, 2010-present). Precise air temperature and wind sensor equipment unknown prior to 2010. These data have been QAQC'd to remove obviously errant readings, highly suspicious readings and artifacts of buoy maintenance.
The buoy is also equipped with below-water surface sensors comprised of thermistors, DO sensors, chlorophyll-a and conductivity sensors. These data are available in separate datasets. The Lake Sunapee buoy is located at a location near Loon Island during the summer months and in the Lake Sunapee harbor during the winter months (2010-current) except the first few years of data (2007-2010), when the buoy was located near Loon Island all year.
