Recruitment data for barnacles and mussels, and abundance data for gastropods are from control plots that are part of a larger, long-term study started in 1996.  Descriptions of the study sites, the coordinates of each plot, methods of data collection and experimental design, and data for recruitment from 1997 to 2012 and for abundances from 1996 to 2008 are available as a supplementary file to a published paper (Petraitis and Dudgeon 2015) and as three data papers in Ecological Archives (Petraitis et al. 2008, 2009, Petraitis and Vidargas 2006).

Plates used for barnacle recruitment are resin castings made from latex molds of natural granite rock. Plates are disk-shaped; approximately 0.67 cm thick and 7.1 cm in diameter (39.6 cm2 in area). Barnacle recruitment in Maine begins in March and continues through May, and so plates for barnacle recruitment were usually placed into the plots in late March and usually collected in late May for an average of 56 days (range: 27–79 days). A complete count of cyprid larvae and newly metamorphosed spat on each plate was done within a day of collection using a dissecting scope at 25×. Data file provides total count per plate.  Data were not collected in 2000, 2009 and 2011.

Settling mussel larvae tend to attach initially to filamentous algae and so fibrous pads were used as substrates for recruitment. Pads were approximately 5 × 5 cm and cut from furnace filters (range of fiber diameter = 0.3–0.5 mm). Pads were wrapped in a 5 cm × 13 cm piece of plastic mesh (width of mesh opening: 4.6–5.0 mm; diameter 1.5 mm), which was closed with two cable ties.  On Swan’s Island, mussels begin to recruit in June, peak in July and early August, and continue through September. Pads were usually placed out in late May and usually collected in late August for an average of 93 days (range: 67–115 days). Upon collection, pads were preserved in 70% isopropyl alcohol. For counting, pads were torn open and rinsed in water over 425 µm and 300 µm sieves.  Mussels trapped on each sieve were rinsed onto a tray with a 2 × 2 cm grid of 32 squares (4 × 8), and mussels were counted in five (1998, 2000, and 2001) or ten (2003–2011) randomly chosen squares.  By 2012, mussel recruits were rare and so the entire tray was counted.  Counts in data file are reported as numbers per 40 cm2 and rounded to the nearest whole number (i.e., equivalent to the total of ten 2 × 2 cm squares). Data were not collected in 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2011

Gastropods were counted in five 50 × 50 cm quadrats per plot from 1997 to 2003; three quadrats per plot were used beginning in 2004.  Data are reported as averages per 0.25 m2.  Sampling was done at low tide between late June and early August.  Spring samples were also collected in 1997, 1998 and 2000.  Data were not collected in 2009.

Environmental data for pH, aragonite saturation ratio (ΩAR) and temperature were extracted from published papers and online databases. Yearly averages in pH and ΩAR from 1997 to 2014 were extracted from published figures (Figures 7 and 8 in Salisbury & Jönsson, 2018).  Monthly average temperatures at 1 m depth and from 2001 to 2018 that were downloaded from NERACOOS for the three buoys that are the closest to Swans Island (http://neracoos.org/datatools/climatologies_display). The buoys are E01 (Central Maine Shelf), F01 (Penobscot Bay) and I01 (Eastern Maine Shelf).  There are no data for earlier than 2001; the 2001 data lacked monthly averages for multiple months.  

Note that until 2010, Testudinalia testudinalis was previously named Tectura testudinalis
