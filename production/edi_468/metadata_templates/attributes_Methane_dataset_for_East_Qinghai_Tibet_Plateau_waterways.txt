mean_DOC	"Average DOC concentration measured in triplicate at each site. Water samples were filtered through 0.45 um polyethersulphone (PES) syringe filters for determination of DOC concentrations. The filtrates were collected in 50 mL plastic vials, to which 200 uL of H2SO4 was added. DOC was determined with a Vario TOC Select analyzer (Elementar, Germany) by high-temperature catalytic oxidation."	numeric	milligramsPerLiter
