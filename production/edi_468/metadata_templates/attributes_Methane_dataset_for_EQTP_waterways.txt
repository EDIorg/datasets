Basins	Which catchment are these sampling sites located in.	categorical				
Sites	The name of each site is the toponym of sampling river reach (details in Sampling_sites.csv).	character				
Altitude	The altitude of each sampling site (above sea level).	numeric	meter			
Air_pressure	Real-time air pressure measured at each site.	numeric	kilopascal			
LogQw	The ratio of river discharge per unit channel width (real-time measured data).	numeric	metersSquaredPerSecond

mean_DOC	"Average DOC concentration measured in triplicate at each site. Water samples were filtered through 0.45 um polyethersulphone (PES) syringe filters for determination of DOC concentrations. The filtrates were collected in 50 mL plastic vials, to which 200 uL of H2SO4 was added. DOC was determined with a Vario TOC Select analyzer (Elementar, Germany) by high-temperature catalytic oxidation."	numeric	milligramsPerLiter
