Nutrient Network data collection follows the protocol identified in https://nutnet.org/exp_protocol but a brief description of the methods are below.

Starting in the year prior to fertilization, we annually sampled aboveground plant biomass and plant community composition. Biomass was sampled by clipping all aboveground biomass (live and dead) in two 0.1 m x 1 m strips, sorting current year's biomass (live biomass) from previous year's biomass (dead biomass), drying the biomass to a constant mass at 60oC, and weighing it to the nearest 0.01 g. The locations of the biomass strips were moved each year to avoid effect of previous harvests on production estimates in subsequent years. We sampled plant community composition in a permanent 1 m x 1 m quadrat by visually estimating the areal cover of each species independently, such that the total summed cover may exceed 100% in multi-layer communities. Soil samples were collected in the year before fertilization started and every 3-5 years thereafter. For this, soil from several 10 cm deep cores were combined for each plot and air dried to a constant mass. All soils were then shipped to a lab at the University of Minnesota (USA) for storage and processing prior to analyses. Total carbon (C) and N were measured at the UMN lab. Soils were shipped to Waypoint Analytical (Memphis, TN, USA) to measure major nutrients (P and K), micronutrients (e.g., Ca and Mg), soil pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and texture of the soil (percent sand, silt and clay; only measured in the Control Plots).
