In July of each year (2011-2015), we collected samples of new vascular plant growth (current year growth leaves or needles of <emphasis>Rhododendron groenlandicum</emphasis>, <emphasis>Andromeda polifolia</emphasis>, <emphasis>Chamaedaphne calyculata</emphasis>, <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis>, <emphasis>Vaccinium oxycoccos</emphasis>, <emphasis>Rubus chamaemorus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Smilacina trifolia</emphasis>).  We collected current year leaves of <emphasis>Eriophorum vaginatum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</emphasis> in 2013-2015, and current year leaves of <emphasis>Kalmia polifolia</emphasis> in 2015.  We marked individuals from which leaves/needles were collected to avoid resampling in subsequent years.  All samples for C and N analysis were sorted for removal of debris, dried for a minimum of 6 days at 55 C, homogenized in a Thomas Wiley Mini-Mill, and analyzed on a Flash EA 1112 Series CN Soil Analyzer.
