Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>; regional background levels <2 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>.  Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition.  To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH<subscript>4</subscript>NO<subscript>3</subscript>) to a bog near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, plus controls (no water or N addition).   In July of each year, we collected new growth of ten species of vascular plants, returned them to the lab, cleaned them, dried and ground them, and ran them on a Flash EA 1112 Series CN Soil Analyzer.  Leaf N concentration responses to increasing N input differed between species.  Increasing N input led to increasing leaf N concentrations in <emphasis>A. polifolia</emphasis>, <emphasis>C. calyculata</emphasis>, <emphasis>V. vitis-idaea</emphasis>, and <emphasis>V. oxycoccos</emphasis>, with differences in N concentrations between years for all of these species except <emphasis>V. vitis-idaea</emphasis>.  There was no leaf N concentration response to increasing N input for <emphasis>E. vaginatum</emphasis>, <emphasis>R. chamaemorus</emphasis>, <emphasis>S. trifolia</emphasis>, or <emphasis>K. polifolia</emphasis>.   Water input alone had no significant effect on leaf N concentration for any of the species (p &gt;= 0.18).  Although aboveground growth of bog vascular plants may be a general response to increasing N deposition, we do not have a species-specific mechanistic understanding of how growth and leaf/needle N concentrations respond to increasing N deposition, however, there appeared to be no strong evidence for luxury consumption of N.
