Detailed collection and analysis methods can be found in Norton et al. 1999 (doi: 10.1023/A:1006115011381) and Navratil et al. 2010 (doi: 10.1007/s10661-010-1527-z).

These data include ambient wet deposition (for East Bear). The experimental watershed, West Bear, received ambient deposition of all species except for NH4 and SO4. 

To calculate NH4 and SO4 deposition for West Bear, add `NH4_mani_eq_ha` or `SO4_mani_eq_ha` to the respective ambient value.

Wet deposition was collected at the site until 2012. For wet deposition post-2012, and for dry deposition for the entire period, we recommend using data from the NADP CASTNET site in Howland, ME (HOW132).
