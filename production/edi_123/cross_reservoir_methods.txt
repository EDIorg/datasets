Vertical profiles of temperature were taken from a boat with a Water Quality Checker U-10 (Horiba Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) between 10:00 h and 14:00 h, usually during the first two hours of this interval. A sampling zone was located within a triangle of three permanent buoys each side about 10 m apart over the maximum depth of the reservoir. The boat was drawn tightly between the buoys to reduce horizontal sway movement with wind to provide more accurate measurements. Temperature was measured at one-meter intervals, at 0.25 m intervals through the zone of greatest temperature change with depth, as light decreased from 10% to less than 1% of that entering the surface, and through the deep layer of algae. Because these temperature data were taken in conjunction with a study examining ecological phenomena occurring during thermal stratification, the most frequent sampling dates occurred in July, August, September and October when vertically migrating deep algae were most common. Other months were sampled less frequently through the years.
