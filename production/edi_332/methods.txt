Our work was performed at Archbold Biological Station, Highlands County, Florida (U.S.A.). Archbold maintains a comprehensive record of the property fire history since the late 1920's. From this data we extracted the occurrence of fires at each of 92 studied patches of Florida rosemary scrub between 1967 and 2017, with individual patches undergoing between 0 and 5 burn events. Archbold also keeps detailed maps with the location and extent of the main vegetation communities and lidar for topographic elevation. We used available GIS polygons to obtain data on patch area and location of each centroid to estimate aggregation using Hanski's index. Additionally, we used zonal statistics via ESRI's ArcGIS 10.3.1 and an existing lidar dataset (flown in April, National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping 2005) to calculate the mean relative elevation (in relation to the nearest mapped wetland boundary) of each patch. Finally, presence/absence data for <emphasis>Hypericum cumulicola</emphasis> was collected by visiting each patch between 2016 and 2018.
