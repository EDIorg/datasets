We present the recorded fire occurrences from 1967 to 2017 for 92 independent Florida Rosemary Scrub patches at Archbold Biological Station, Lake Placid, Florida. In addition, we include a series of habitat attributes, including patch area, patch isolation (described by the Hanski's index), and relative elevation, associated with those patches, as well as presence/absence data for <emphasis>Hypericum cumulicola</emphasis>, a Florida endemic plant.
