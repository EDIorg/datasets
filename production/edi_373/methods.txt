To collect peatland porewater as a function of depth, we used 2.5-cm diameter slotted PVC pipe, segmented into 20 cm depth increments, with Tygon tubing extending from the bottom of each section to the surface. On each sampling date, we used a 60 mL syringe to evacuate the full volume of water from the topmost segment from which water could be collected prior to removing 60 mL of porewater and field-filtering through Whatman 41 filter paper into sample bottles. In 2011 and 2012, there were 11 and 10 sampling events, respectively, including 8 events each year on the day following N addition. Sampling was reduced to 3 events (June, July, and August) per year in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  We froze samples prior to shipping to Villanova University for analysis of NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N (phenate method, Seal AA3 AutoAnalyzer), NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N (hydrazine reduction method, Seal AA3 AutoAnalyzer), and total dissolved N (Shimadzu TOC-V<subscript>CSH</subscript> analyzer, with prefiltration through 0.45 &mu;m filters). Dissolved organic nitrogen concentration (DON) was calculated as total dissolved N minus NH<subscript>4</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>-N and NO<subscript>3</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>-N concentrations.
