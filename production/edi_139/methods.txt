Vascular plant live NPP was estimated for each species using a nondestructive volumetric method that yields data on species composition and total production. Volume measurements of all individual plants were recorded at peak biomass (September) each year in permanently located 1-m2 plots (N ranges from 22-106 plots depending on the year and ecosystem). Biomass was calculated allometrically via linear regression models with intercepts through the origin; these were developed for each species over multiple years from plants collected outside of the permanent sampling plots.

To determine SPEI, climate variables were recorded at three long-term meteorological stations located in the Great Plains grassland, ecotone between Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert grassland, and ecotone between Chihuahuan Desert grassland and shrubland. Variables included air and soil temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed and direction. We gap-filled missing daily data using data from the geographically nearest station within the SNWR. We also obtained monthly average air temperature and monthly accumulated precipitation from 1900 to 2014 for the Socorro, NM, USHCN site (298387, cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/ushcn.html). 
We calculated potential evapotranspiration using the Thornthwaite method, then determined six-month integrated SPEI ending 30 Sept package cran.r-project.org/package=SPEI.
