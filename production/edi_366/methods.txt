Using a 1.2-m long point frame anchored permanently in each plot with PVC tubes, we characterized bog plant community composition for 5 years beginning in 2011 between July 17-19 of each year.  We recorded all species touched by a vertical 1-mm rod from 30 points placed 3.5 cm apart on the frame and calculated relative frequencies for each plot.
