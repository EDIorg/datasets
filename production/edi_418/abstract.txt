Here, we deposit data from a vegetation survey conducted in 2014. The data was collected to document current vegetation patterns in the region, parameterize species distribution models, and assess community turnover in flower color. The survey was conducted in the Upper Gunnison Basin and the environs around the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, CO, USA, spanning an elevation gradient from 2700-4000m above sea level. Data were acquired through visual estimates of percent cover of species within replicate quadrats in a site. We include information scraped from the USDA Plants Database (https://plants.sc.egov.usda.gov/java/) on species lifeform, life history, and invasive status.
