Improvements in air quality have led to ecosystem recovery from acidic deposition, but the mechanisms and trajectories of this recovery are not fully understood. Here, we present long-term stream response and recovery data for paired watersheds at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) during declining ambient SO4 and NO3 in precipitation. East Bear (EB) received ambient deposition from 1989 to 2018; West Bear (WB) received artificially elevated N+S from 1989 to 2016. The WB treatment was discontinued after 2016, the beginning of the recovery from both the experimental N+S and ambient decline. Stream SO4 in WB gradually declined after the treatment ended, from ~147 μeq L-1 in 2010-16 to ~126 μeq L-1 in 2017-18. The declining S inputs induced desorption of SO4 from soil phase surfaces, with stream loss far exceeding precipitation input. At the current rate of recovery, it will be many decades before the WB stream returns to pre-treatment SO4 concentrations. In contrast, NO3 is only weakly adsorbed in soil, and WB stream NO3 concentrations rapidly declined from ~39 μeq L-1 in 2010-16 to ~5 μeq L-1 in 2017-18, comparable to the N-limited EB stream. The acid anions are strongly coupled to base cation chemistry in streams, and there was a distinct hysteretic response of Ca and Mg to the chronic acidification, as (Ca+Mg) increased rapidly during the initial years, followed by declining values due to depletion of the soil exchange complex. This 30-year monitoring study (1989-2019) provides insights into recovery mechanisms from acidic deposition and highlights the role of abiotic processes in soil that mediate nutrient cycling and retention. Documenting the rapid response of N alongside the slower recovery for S identifies the temporal resolution necessary for other whole-watershed recovery studies.
