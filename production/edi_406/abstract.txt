This data base contains estimates of damage to lupin (Lupinus lepidus var. lobbii) by several species of leaf-tying and root-boring moth larvae (Lepidoptera), along with associated estimates of vegetation cover, in primary successional sites at Mount St. Helens.  The surveys began in 1993 and are ongoing; This database includes data for 1994, 1995, and 1998-2017. Surveys were located at a variety of primary successional sites on Mount St. Helensâ€™ Pumice Plain. Surveys generally occurred in mid to late August, when leaf-miner damage is at its maximum, but prior to maximum damage by root-borers.  The number of sites, location of sites, and types of data collected varied across years and, but lupin cover, bare ground, and % lupin damage are reliable across the time series. 

Please note, leaf-miner damage has been been temporarily deleted from lupin.csv. Contact data authors if you seek a collaboration using the deleted data.
