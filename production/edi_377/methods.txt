Soil samples from a range of land cover classes were collected during the summer of 2015 within the city limits of Madison, WI (Ziter and Turner 2018). Twenty sites were selected from each of five land cover classes: urban forest, urban grassland, open space, low-density, medium-density (represented as F, G, O, L, and M, respectively, Fig. 1). These land cover types encompass areas such as city parks (open space), residential backyards, highway roadsides, and prairies. Site selection and soil characteristics are described in Ziter and Turner (2018). In Dane County, soils are mainly sandy-loam glacial till, and in Madison, soils are predominantly Alfisols, with some Mollisols being found in forest and oak–savanna vegetation and wet sedge meadows (Bockheim and Hartemink 2017). In 2016, 20 road-terrace sites were sampled (represented as R). Sites were distributed throughout the city and chosen based on accessibility to terraces along major roads. 

For all land types except road terraces, samples were collected from within a 30 m x 30 m area in each of the five land types. At each site, four separate 5m x 5m plots were developed in each quadrant, from which samples were taken. Four samples in total were taken at each 30 m x 30 m site (n = 400, 100 sites x 4 plots). At road terrace sites, samples were taken along a 40m transect at four 15 m intervals. Transects ran parallel to the road within 3 feet of the curb, or at the center of the road median. Soil from one forest plot was not measured for EC, and therefore total measured samples equal 379. In both sampling years, soil samples were taken as a 10 cm deep soil core. 

Samples were air dried for 24-72 hours, then put in a drying oven for 24 hours at 60 degC. Once dry, samples were sieved with a 200 µm mesh filter to remove gravel and other large non-soil particles. If large solidified clumps had formed during the drying process, they were broken up and re-sieved. A homogenized 5-gram sub-sample was then taken from each replicate. To each sub-sample, 10 mL of deionized water was added in a 30 mL HDPE plastic vial. The mixture was allowed to saturate for at least 15 minutes, with frequent re-suspension of the settled solids. Electrical conductivity (EC) of the mixture was then measured with a Thermo Scientific Orion Star A222 portable conductivity meter. A 1-point calibration was applied at the beginning of each day using a 500 µS/cm standard. Bulk densities and hydraulic conductivities for F, G, O, L, and M sites were obtained from Ziter and Turner (2018), but were not measured for road-terrace sites (https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5pr17). 

Percent impervious surface at 30-m resolution was obtained from the National Land Cover Database (https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php). The amount of impervious surface surrounding each site was calculated in circular buffer zones around each sampling location at 30 m radii.
