Air and soil temperature were measured from 2001 to 2015 at three soil depths -- surface (organic soil), and 10 and 25 cm in the mineral soil, in both watersheds, and in both the hardwood and softwood forest types. Temperature measurements were recorded every three hours using Onset HOBO sensors (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Soil moisture measurements are available from 2003 to 2016. Soil moisture was recorded every three hours at 10 and 25 cm depths using HOBO™️ Micro Station data loggers equipped with 10HS Smart Sensors (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA).
