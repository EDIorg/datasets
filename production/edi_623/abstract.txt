This dataset includes 15-year soil temperature records for the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). Onset HOBO™️ data loggers were installed in the hardwood as well as softwood stands of the two watersheds, and air and soil temperatures were recorded from 2001 to 2016. Soil temperature data are available for the organic horizon and for 10 and 25 cm depths in the mineral horizon, at a three-hour timestep.
