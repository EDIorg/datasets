Five filter papers (Whatman 41; 70 mm diam.) were placed inside of nylon jacket liner fabric bags, and sealed.  In May 2012, we placed 10 sealed, nylon mesh letter bags containing five filter papers (Whatman 41; 70 mm diam.) into the peat in each plot.  We retrieved five of these bags in October 2012 and the remaining five in October 2013. Each subsequent May until 2014, we buried 10 bags in each plot and in each October and removed 10 bags, five from the previous year and five placed at the beginning of the current year.  Upon retrieval, bags were cleaned, dried, and weighed.
