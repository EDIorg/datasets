To determine whether buffel grass presence suppresses the recruitment of native perennials under field conditions, we surveyed and marked seedlings weekly for 10 weeks during July and August, 2013, on 102 plots of 4 m2. As fewer than 5% of emerging seedlings survive to establish in this system (Bowers et al. 2004), the area and time required to remove sufficient buffel grass to track survival of seedlings surviving even a single year would be logistically prohibitive. We therefore rely on differences in early survival to draw inference about changes to overall recruitment rates and incorporate them into a stage-structure population model focused on palo verde dynamics for context. 

We compared native seedling emergence and survival rates between grass removal plots, control plots (with buffel grass remaining), and never-invaded comparison plots. We established 34 blocks of 3 plots each (102 plots total). Plots within a block were chosen to have similar slope, rock content, and mature native plants. Blocks were selected so that two of the plots contained buffel grass, and one of the plots was in an uninvaded area at least two meters from the nearest buffel grass of the contiguous patch, which we refer to as the uninvaded plot. One of the two plots containing buffel grass was randomly selected for buffel grass removal, and became the removal plot. We refer to the other as a buffel grass plot. We did not pull plants completely in order to avoid confounding the effects of disturbance with the effects of buffel grass. Instead, we removed all buffel grass within removal plots and within a 1 m buffer zone of removal plots by mowing in June when plots were selected, and then spraying the resprouting bases with herbicide (3% glyphosate) in July after the rains started. To ensure that equal amounts of water and nutrients were added to each plot, we sprayed equivalent amounts of herbicide on the bare ground in and around buffel grass plots and the never-invaded plots.
