Reactive oxygen species (ROS), formed during redox fluctuations in iron-rich soils, have been known to stimulate lignin degradation, although not much is known about how they alter soil organic matter (SOM) composition and interaction with mineral surfaces. We conducted a laboratory experiment to see how ROS altered SOM composition and adsorptive fractionation onto Fe-mineral surfaces. We reacted water extracts of SOM with ·OH, produced by the Fenton reaction, and then conducted a sorption experiment of the extracts with goethite to analyze the amount and quality of SOM adsorbed. The Fenton reaction preferentially consumed low-O, mostly aromatic molecules, and new high-O molecules were detected post-Fenton, nearly half of which were carbohydrate-like. Although the amount of C adsorbed did not change after oxidation, the post-Fenton adsorbed molecules were more oxidized. Pre-Fenton adsorption was dominated by aromatic molecules (90%), but post-Fenton, the adsorbed molecules were 75% aromatic and 25% carbohydrate-like. We show that the ·OH radical oxidized SOM and shifted patterns of adsorption to a more oxidized pool. Because adsorption to minerals is thought to stabilize SOM, our results suggest that ROS may alter the availability and stabilization patterns of SOM
