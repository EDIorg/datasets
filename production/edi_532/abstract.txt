This dataset contains the results on an experiment whose aim was to determine whether competitive displacement accounted for a species' local distribution. Within a grassland in southern Arizona, Stipa neomexicana, a C3 grass, was found to occur only on dry ridge crests with low total grass cover, while total grass cover is greater below the ridge crests in moister, lowâ€”lying areas. It was hypothesized that Stipa neomexicana was limited to these dry ridges by competitive exclusion. This hypothesis was tested by removal experiments conducted at three positions along the topographic gradient. The responses of Stipa were compared with those of Aristida glauca and other neighboring grass species, all of which are C4 grasses (Stipa being the only C3 grass in that area). This experiment was carried out from 1980 to 1983, in a grassland near Sonoita, Santa Cruz County, Arizona, USA.
