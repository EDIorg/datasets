geog_descr <- "lake and watershed: Lake Sunapee is located in the Sugar River watershed within Sullivan and Merrimack Counties, New Hampshire, USA. There are sixteen streams (including ephemeral streams) which flow into Lake Sunapee and a single outlet from the lake.  The Lake Sunapee watershed covers approximately 12094 hectares including Lake Sunapee itself, which is approximately 1667 hectares. The transducers are located in six inflows to the lake: Otter Pond Brook (tributary #505; sub-watershed is 7661 hectares), Chandler Johnson (tributary #665; sub-watershed is 2170 hectares), Blodgett Brook South Branch (tributary #788; sub-watershed is 359 hectares), Blodgett Brook North Branch (tributary #790; sub watershed is 954 hectares), King Hill (tributary #805; sub-watershed is 923 hectares) and Herrick South (tributary #830; sub watershed is 314 hectares). The sub-watersheds listed here are smaller watersheds within the Lake Sunapee watershed delineated in ArcGIS using the watershed tool from the Lake Sunapee Protective Associationâ€™s long term monitoring.  A reference transducer used to track atmospheric barometric pressure is located on land near the lake outlet at Sunapee Harbor."
