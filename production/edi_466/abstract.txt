Six in-stream HOBO pressure transducers and one reference HOBO pressure transducer have been deployed within the Lake Sunapee, NH, USA watershed since 2010. The transducers record data every 15 minutes, and data are downloaded approximately three times per year (early Spring, mid Summer and late Fall). Shortly after download, the data are processed to estimate stream depth using HOBOware's Barometric Compensation Assistant and converted to a .csv file in HOBOware.  The data have been QAQC'd to recode obviously errant data to NA using R programming language. No data transformation has occurred beyond basic QAQC of the data. The barometric pressure data from the reference transducer located on land are also included.
