Seven reefs in Moorea French Polynesia were examined for sediment and turf characteristics to establish a baseline for naturally occurring proportions of sediment within the turf matrix. At each of the seven sites turf filament heights and sediment depths within the turf matrix were measured using a galvanized mesh measuring device calibrated by 1mm increments. All surveys were conducted between 2-3m in depth between April-May of 2016. We then conducted a two-factor experiment where sediment depth was manipulated at two sites surveyed with strong differences in turf communities (Maharepa and Gump). Our experiment ran for 30 days, with sediment treatments maintained every four days.
