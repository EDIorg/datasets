While biological invasions have been the subject of considerable attention both historically and recently the factors controlling the susceptibility of communities to plant invasions remain controversial. In order to examine relationships between plant community characteristics, soil characteristics, and nonnative plant invasion, we surveyed 44 sites in southeastern New York State, USA in the summer of 1998. We examined both plant community characteristics (diversity and species membership) and soil characteristics (litter depth, pH, nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, and soil texture). The data collected was then used to study patterns of invasion both within and among broad forest community types, in order to determine what factors were most closely associated with the success of invasive plants
