Campaign to measure diel cycle of lake-atmosphere carbon dioxide flux in different seasons. This is part of a larger synthesis working group for GLEON called DC-FLUX. Floating chamber with in-situ CO2 sensor was deployed between July 2017 and April 2018 over four campaigns of three-hourly samples taken by two chambers with three replicates each by boat and in one campaign, also near shore. These data are being synthesized with similar measurements made in multiple lakes for a forthcoming manuscript.
