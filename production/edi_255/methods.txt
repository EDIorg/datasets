Experimental sites: 

Experiments were conducted within eight 50 ha experimental landscapes at the Savannah River Site, an 80,000 ha National Environmental Research Park near Aiken, South Carolina. Each landscape represented a statistical block, with five open patches created by clearing mature pine plantation forest and establishing longleaf pine savanna after prescribed burns. Each block contained four peripheral patches, located 150 m from each edge of a central 100 9 100 m patch (Fig. 1). A 150 9 25 m corridor connected the central patch to one peripheral 100 9 100 m "connected" patch. The remaining three peripheral patches were either "winged" (100 9 100 m square with two 75 9 25 m wings off opposite sides) or "rectangular" (100 9 137.5 m); in each block, there was a duplicate winged or rectangular patch. Following creation of the experimental landscapes, the residual mature pine plantation formed the matrix (Orrock et al. 2003). This design controls for patch area-winged and rectangular patches have equal area to the connected patch plus corridor-and tests for two possible mechanisms by which corridors may affect matrix seed predation: increased patch connectivity (connectivity effects) and increased patch edge-to-area ratio (patch shape effects). If corridors function via connectivity effects, matrix seed predation should be dissimilar around connected and winged patches, which differ in connectivity but are similar in shape. If corridors function via patch shape effects, matrix seed predation should be dissimilar around winged and rectangular patches, which differ in shape but not connectivity. We used seeds of three perennial herbaceous species to quantify matrix seed predation and examine its relationship with dispersal mode, which was shown to predict the magnitude of connectivity-enhanced spillover (Brudvig et al. 2009). The three species were Phytolacca americana (American pokeweed; Phytolaccaceae; seed weight 4.61-7.19 mg, length 2.91-3.05 mm, and width 2.52-2.66 mm (95% CIs, n = 15); bird dispersed), Carphephorus bellidifolius (sandywoods chaffhead; Asteraceae; seed weight 1.15-3.17 mg, length 3.98-4.72 mm, and width 0.93-1.05 mm; wind dispersed), and Anthaenantia villosa (green silky scale; Poaceae; seed weight 1.32-2.38 mg, length 2.84-3.04 mm, and width 1.27-1.47 mm; unassisted). P. americana has previously been shown to be seed limited in this landscape (Orrock et al. 2006). The apparent viability of A. villosa and C. bellidifolius seeds was determined by gently squeezing them; those that resisted pressure were considered viable and used in experimental trials (Ball and Miller 1990). P. americana is consumed by vertebrate frugivores and seeds are defecated free of fruit pulp (McDonnell et al. 1984); to mimic this condition and present seeds in an ecologically realistic manner, we extracted P. americana seeds from berries and rinsed the seeds free of pulp. Similarly, for the other two seed species, seeds were presented with their hulls intact, as though they were naturally dispersed. 

Linking seed removal to spillover:

We quantified seed predation in the forested matrix surrounding one connected, winged, and rectangular patch in each block using seed removal depots (Fig. 1). The central patch and one randomly selected duplicate peripheral patch per landscape were not used in the present experiment. To facilitate comparison of our results with the spillover noted in this system (Brudvig et al. 2009), we established depots along the same transects originally used to quantify spillover by Brudvig et al. (2009), which extended 50 m into the matrix from each corner of selected patches (Fig. 1). We set three 19 9 14 9 10 cm clear plastic seed removal depots, spaced 1 m apart, at 0, 15, and 50 m from the patch edge along each transect. Depots had a 2.5 cm circular opening in two adjoining sides and a tight fitting lid, assuring no seeds were lost to wind, rain, or other non-predation events. Openings allowed both arthropods and rodents access to all depots. When placed in the field, a thin layer of sand was spread across the bottom of each depot, upon which were laid twenty seeds of a single species; one depot per species was used at each location, and depots were arranged in the same order at all locations by which seed species it contained. The number of seeds per depot is similar to that used in previous seed predation studies (e.g. Orrock and Damschen 2005). Seed removal trials were conducted at all locations over two 20 day periods in 2009, from 18 August to 7 September and 12 November to 2 December. For analysis, we pooled these two periods to gain a comprehensive picture of seed predation rates over the entire time period when seeds would be vulnerable after dispersal (e.g. in late summer) and prior to germination in early spring. Following field trials, we quantified the number of remaining intact seeds and the number of empty (i.e., predated) seed hulls from each tray. Depots that were disturbed by wind or animals (e.g., flipped or rolled onto a side) while deployed were excluded from data analysis. Removed seeds were assumed to have been preyed upon, a common assumption in seed-removal studies (Moles et al. 2003) that was supported by our observations (see results); data from P. americana in this study system also suggest that removal is indicative of seed loss and subsequent plant establishment (Orrock et al. 2006).
