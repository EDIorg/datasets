This study aims to create a three-dimensional sediment profile map of Lake Mendota, located in Dane County, WI, using subbottom profiling (SBP). Knowing the location, quantity, and relative composition of the sediments will give us lake-wide relative deposition rates and spatial differences in deposition, as well as what from the sediment phosphorus pool is available for recycling. Furthermore, knowing the significance of phosphorous sediment flux will aid in creating more accurate models, which can help in creating better policies that affect the lake such as land management practices.
