This data was collected using the Tritech SeaKing Parametric Sub Bottom Profiler (SBP). The SBP was mounted to the side of a john boat and was used to survey Lake Mendota. Manuals for the SeaKing SBP can be found here: https://www.tritech.co.uk/product/parametric-sub-bottom-profiling-seaking-sbp.

Data is in the proprietary form (v4log). The data is labeled with the date of the survey, and the run number from that surveying outing.

To convert the proprietary V4LOG files, the software Seanet Dumplog can be used and can be downloaded here: https://www.tritech.co.uk/support-software/tritech-seanet-tools-utility-programs-for-seanet-pro-software
