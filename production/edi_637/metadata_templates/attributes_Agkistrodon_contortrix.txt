pattern_formula	"Example of how to read a pattern formula using 6cm+1 1/2 L+1 2/2 R+3 5/2 L+3 4/2 R: 6 complete cross bands (marks) on the animal; behind band #1, one half-band on L side and two half-bands on R side; behind band #3 are 5 half-bands L and 4 R. These can often get quite involved, such as: 11cm+4 1/2 L+1 1/2 L+8 1/2 L+10 1/2 L (#11 dbl R) or they may be quite simple such as just 15cm. As for (#11 dbl R) this indicates band 11 was split on the R side of the animal. On occasion, the + between fields of the pattern formula were omitted"	character			NR	Missing value
