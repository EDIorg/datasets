These can often get quite involved, such as: 11cm+4 1/2 L+1 1/2 L+8 1/2 L+10 1/2 L (#11 dbl R) or they may be quite simple such as just 15cm. As for (#11 dbl R) this indicates band 11 was split on the R side of the animal. On occasion, the + between fields of the pattern formula were omitted"	character			NR	Missing value
