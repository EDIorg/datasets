Lakes are undergoing a variety of changes that may alter their role in the global carbon cycle. Lake temperatures are increasing at the same time that lakes in many regions are experiencing long-term increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. The balance between rates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) is an important determinant of CO2 outgassing from lakes and thus it is important to understand factors regulating ER rates in these systems. Temperature is known to regulate rates of ER, but other factors have the potential to modulate this relationship. One such regulator may be the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the system. Theory suggests that ER may increase more with temperature in lakes dominated by allochthonous, refractory material than in systems dominated by more autochthonous DOM. To test this theory, we conducted a mesocosm study where half of the mesocosms received water from a naturally occurring autochthonous DOM source and the other half from an allochthonous DOM source. We monitored water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in each mesocosm using in-situ high frequency DO sensors. After 27 days we used this data to calculate daily ER for each mesocosm. We then related daily ER to mean nighttime temperature and tested whether the relationship was different in the two DOM treatments. Treatments dominated by allochthonous DOM had a greater temperature dependence of respiration than those dominated by autochthonous DOM. These results suggest that as lake temperatures continue to increase, ER will increase more in lakes dominated by allochthonous DOM than those dominated by autochthonous DOM.
