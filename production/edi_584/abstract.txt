Centaurea stoebe (Asteraceae; spotted knapweed) is an emerging invader in northeast US, and is a major invasive plant in the northern Midwest and western USA. Although it has been present in New York State (NYS) for over 100 years, its apparent recent population increases and spread provide a rare opportunity to study a plant in the early stages of invasion. Therefore, a study was carried out understand how distinct environmental factors influence the distribution, density and change in density C. stoebe at different spatial scales within its novel range in the northeastern USA. First, we collected field data on the occurrence, density and change in density of this species in North Eastern United States, from 2013 to 2014. Then, using species distribution models, we assessed the potential influence of environmental factors on the invasion of spotted knapweed in northeast US. Within different parts of C. stoebe‘s range, different factors explained its occurrence, density and change in density over 2 years. Across northeast US, climate and soil factors were the most influential predictors explaining C. stoebe‘s distribution, while within Long Island in southeastern NYS and the Adirondack Mountains in northern NYS, precipitation and disturbance respectively were the most important. These results are published in the paper titled The influence of environmental factors on the distribution and density of invasive Centaurea stoebe across Northeastern USA (Akin-Fajiye and Gurevitch, 2018).
