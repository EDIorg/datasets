Weekly and subweekly monitoring data collected from June to October 2014 were used to study organic carbon dynamics in Falling Creek Reservoir, a drinking water reservoir owned and managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority and located in Vinton, Virginia, USA. The dataset consists of: 1) daily inflow volumes and the temperature of water entering the reservoir, measured at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir’s primary inflow tributary; 2) weekly to subweekly depth profiles of temperature and oxygen collected at the deepest site of the reservoir adjacent to the dam; and 3) approximately weekly grab samples of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved carbon dioxide collected from subsurface (0.1 m depth) and just above the sediments (9.0 m depth). This dataset also includes approximately weekly grab samples of organic carbon and dissolved carbon dioxide in the inflow tributary measured at the gauged weir, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the inflow tributary measured at the gauged weir, and organic carbon deposition rates measured at 8 m depth at the deepest site of the reservoir approximately every 4 weeks with sedimentation traps.
