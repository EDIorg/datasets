This dataset includes soil chemistry data for the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). The BBWM consists of two watersheds, the reference East Bear (EB), receiving ambient deposition, and the treated West Bear (WB), which received experimental elevated N+S deposition for 27 years. Quantitative soil pits (71x71 cm) and mini-pits (30x30 cm) were dug at multiple times over the three decades of this experiment, and samples were analyzed for chemistry. Data are available both, as concentrations, as well as nutrient stocks for each watershed.
