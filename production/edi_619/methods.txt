Replicate quantitative soil pedons were sampled in the four compartments at BBWM (i.e., EB hardwoods, EB softwoods, WB hardwoods, and WB softwoods) during 1998, 2006, and 2010. The 1998 and 2010 campaigns included quantification of both soil physical and chemical properties; the other campaigns included only chemical analyses. 

The sampling design consisted of 40 quantitative pedons excavated to the bottom of the solum, and 40 additional mini-pedons excavated to a mineral soil depth of 25 cm and separated into the O-horizon, and the 0–5 cm and 5–25 cm mineral soil increments. The full quantitative pedons sampled in 1998 involved the quantitative removal of all O-horizon soil within a 71 cm × 71 cm frame to the top of the underlying mineral soil. The E-horizon, where present, was excluded from sampling due to its thin, inconsistent presence and limited chemical reactivity. The mineral soil was quantitatively excavated in 1998 within the 71 cm × 71 cm frame at depth increments of 0–5, 5–25, and 25 cm to the top of the C-horizon (i.e., 25-C horizon). A grab sample of the upper C-horizon was obtained from all pedons where possible. 

In 2006, the 40 full quantitative pedons that were initially established in 1998 were re-sampled for chemical analysis by locating new excavations 2 m east of the original quantitative pedons. In 2006, only the O-horizons were quantitatively sampled using a 30 cm × 30 cm frame. Mineral soil depth increments were the same as in 1998 and included a grab sample of the upper C-horizon. In 2010, the full 40 quantitative pedons were resampled, and the organic as well as mineral horizons were quantitatively excavated as in 1998.
