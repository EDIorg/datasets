Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were measured over a period of 4 decades in a 3<superscript>rd</superscript>-order reach of White Clay Creek, a stream with a forested riparian zone in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Piedmont.  Stream water was filtered through pre-combusted glass fiber filters and analyzed in a variety of dissolved organic carbon analyzers.  The data have been used to investigate organic matter biogeochemistry and the role of dissolved organic matter in supporting heterotrophic metabolism in the stream.
