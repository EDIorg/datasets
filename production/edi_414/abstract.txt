The impacts of habitat fragmentation and restoring connectivity are difficult to disentangle from other drivers such as area and patch shape and may change over longer time scales. This dataset includes long-term colonization and extinction rates and plant species richness data based on plant occupancy records from experimental landscapes that manipulate habitat connectivity through the presence of habitat corridors, while controlling for patch area and shape. The experimental landscapes are located at the Savannah River Site near Aiken, SC, USA (i.e., “SRS Corridor Experiment”).
