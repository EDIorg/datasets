Interactions between waves and large bottom roughness were investigated using Large Eddy Simulations of oscillatory flow over infinite hemisphere arrays. Simulations were made using the open source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Wave amplitude, period, and hemisphere spacing were varied to investigate the dependence of kinematics and dynamics on dimensionless parameters, including the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC), the ratio of wave orbital excursion to roughness element size. This archive includes the input files and user written routines to reproduce the simulations in the paper.
