Eugenia_species	"Study species, which are one of three congeners: Eugenia foetida, E. axillaris, or E. uniflora. "	categorical				
soil	"Soil treatment, which is one of two treatments: nonsterile or sterile. For the sterile treatment, we sterilized half of these field-collected soils from the current and new ranges. The nonsterile treatment was untreated fresh, field-collected soil. The nonsterile and sterile control inocula comprised 5% of the mass of the pot."	categorical				
site	"Soil biota was collected in the form of fresh field-collected soil from one of two sources: the current home range [Central Florida (Cape Canaveral, FL), South Florida (Hugh Taylor Birch State Park)] or within the projected new range [North Florida (Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, Florida)]."	categorical				
climate	"Future temperature conditions of the northern site were estimated with a Low, B1 emission scenario; for a range of SRES emissions scenarios, and using global climate projections from the Fourth IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2007;  Girvetz et al. 2009).  Pots were placed in growth chambers where diurnal variation in daylength and temperatures were simulated, with the high and low daily temperatures determined by the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the month of May in Jacksonville, FL (Florida Climate Center, Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies), the northernmost site from where soil was collected. The pots experienced environmental conditions simulated for current (2010) and future (2050) conditions, with 10 hours of light per day and 30/17  C and 31/18 C and day/night temperatures, respectively. "	categorical				
pot_num	"Pot number, within species, soil, site and climate treatments."	categorical				
total_biomass	"Twelve weeks following initiation of germination, the remaining plants (maximum of 4) were harvested for total above and below-ground biomass.  Shoots were cut at ground level and oven-dried separately in paper bags at 60 C for 2 days. The roots were carefully washed to remove soil particles and also oven-dried at 60 C in paper bags. After drying, shoots and roots were weighed with a precision balance to determine dry weight."	numeric	gram			
chamber	"Six growth chambers (A, B, C, D, E, and F) were used to allow seeds to germinate and grow, under current and future temperature conditions of the future site in north Florida."	categorical
