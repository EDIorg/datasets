Literature search and screening protocol 

A systematic review in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) framework (Moher, 2009). A search was carried out on the Web of Science database for search terms related to land use, biodiversity and yield (see below for the full search term and all refinement options employed). All articles published since 1 January 1990 in English or Spanish were included. The final search resulted in 9,909 studies.

Studies meeting the following selection criteria were included: Studies had to measure both species richness and yield in the same site in response to the application of conventional land‐use intensification. This included studies measuring the effect of conventional intensification on several sites in response to different intensities (i.e. space‐for‐time substitutes). Out of the full initial set of papers, astracts of 6,116 sudies were manually screened. Studies were retained only if they contained information about land use, species richness, and/or yield. In order to filter the remaining 3,793 studies, a machine‐learning algorithm, based on ensembles of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), was used (developed for systematic reviews of the medical literature; see Wallace, Trikalinos, Lau, Brodley, & Schmid, 2010). The machine‐learning algorithm correctly identified 84% of the manually screened studies as being relevant, with a specificity of 51% (standard deviation 0.016), that is, the model eliminated half of the irrelevant. The full text documents of all studies identified as potentially relevant (1,371), both screened manually or through machine learning, were acquired and processed further.

Data extraction and validation 

From these 1,371 studies, 115 studies had sufficient data to be included. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes for control (lower land‐use intensity) and treatment (higher land‐use intensity) were extracted from the text, tables or figures (using ImageJ; Schneider, Rasband, & Eliceiri, 2012). If data were not completely available in the main document and the Supplementary Material, it was request requested from the corresponding author. Studies that did not report means or sample sizes were excluded from the analysis. This resulted in a total of 115 studies that were used in subsequent analyses. Data coding and data review were undertaken by eight of the co‐authors. Initially, studies were coded as a group to assure inter‐coder consistency and reliability. Subsequently, frequent internal reviews were conducted to maintain consistency. Each document was coded by at least two of the co‐authors. 

Only those studies were incorporated which included, both, information on species richness and yield in response to conventional land‐use intensification in the same locations. The measurements for both variables also had to be collected at the same area (but possibly in differently sized plots), excluding studies that, for example, measured species richness in plots or landscapes and used coarser‐scale statistics (e.g. sub‐national) for yield. It was assumed that the original study authors sampled yield and species richness using appropriate spatial units for both. Based on the type of product that was harvested the production system (crop, green fodder or wood) was first classified according to the description of the land use provided in the original paper.

Land‐use intensity and intensification classification

The classification system for land‐use intensity was based on a pre‐defined set of management practices. Land‐use intensity was defined based on energy use and labor as a combination of input intensity (e.g. type of fertilizer/pesticide application) and aspects related to output or harvest intensity (e.g. type of harvest, number of harvests per year) but not the actual outputs (i.e. yields) themselves in order to avoid circularity. While this conceptualization of intensification will identify more intensive systems based on the type of management practices implemented (e.g. no fertilizer vs. organic vs. chemical fertilizer), it does not classify land‐use intensity based on quantities of a management practice (e.g. kg nitrogen applied per area). Thus, the classification of intensification best reflects conventional intensification, rather than other forms of intensification (e.g. sustainable intensification in agriculture; Rockström et al., 2017) and it also allows for comparisons across production systems and regions (Hudson et al., 2014).

For studying a gradient of land‐use intensification steps, first three broad land‐use intensity classes were defined: low, medium and high, with separate criteria for each of the globally most common production systems: crops, wood and green fodder(see Table 1). In a second step, we distinguished different degrees of conventional land‐use intensification within each study in order to form intensification cases for the subsequent analysis. Land‐use intensification could occur in small steps, meaning an increase in pre‐existing management activities that does not lead to substantial changes in the production system (i.e. no change of land‐use intensity class). In this way, cases for the intensification steps low‐low, medium‐medium and high‐high were formed. More substantial changes in land‐use may lead to a change of a production system into another land‐use intensity class, resulting in cases covering the low‐medium, medium‐high and low‐high intensification steps.

By including measurements for different species groups and/or types of yield, a publication could provide several cases of land‐use intensification (e.g. one response of crop yield and the responses of plants, birds and insects to a given intensification step would result in three species richness cases and one yield case) leading to unequal numbers of cases for species richness and yield.

Case extraction from all 115 studies and based on different land‐use intensification steps, taxa or product types as described above, resulted in a total of 449 cases, 292 cases for species richness and 157 for yield.

Table 1 | Characterization of land-use intensity classes. The land-use intensity classes low, medium and high were characterized separately for the three product groups crops, green fodder and wood. Land-use intensity was associated to a certain class based on core aspects of land-use (e.g. fertilizer application, grazing regime, species management). This was done separately for each product type.

biological pest control,
no fertilization,
rotational cultivation, possibly with fallow year, natural irrigation	

Low - Green Fodder:

occasional mowing,
no addition/removal of species	,

Low - Wood:
either combination of or low selective and partial logging,
no fertilization,
low levels of thinning, heterogeneous age structure, naturally developing forest, usually multiple species forest

Medium - Crops:

Table 2 Description of data used in the analysis. Overview and meta-data of the variables either coded directly from the studies or extracted from external data sources and used in the analysis.

Study Case - Each study-case corresponds to a unique set of response statistics. Hence, a single study can include multiple cases if it reports on more than two land-use intensities, species groups, or products, or if it reports on several locations that differ in covariates, e.g. climate.

Longitude/Latitude - The geographic location of a study either as directly reported by the authors or, if missing, georeferenced by the coders based on a location description. 

Intensification step - Level of baseline and increased land-use intensity class based on the classification given in table 1. The intensity classes low, medium and high were used to form pairs ([initial]-[final]) of intensification steps (low-low, low-medium, medium-medium, medium-high, high-high and low-high). 

Species group - Broad class of species group, i.e. vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants.

Product - Broad class of harvested product, i.e. crop, green fodder, and wood.

Climate - Broad climate zone according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, i.e. polar, cold (continental), temperate, arid, and tropical.

Land-use history - Broad class of time of first significant use (table 3), i.e. 5950 BC, 50 BC, 1450, 1950, after 1950. And categorized according to the major developments of agriculture.

Dependency of yield and species richness measure - An indication of whether species richness and yield are measured from the same species group, in which case species richness and production are considered to be linked rather than independent. 

Dependency of intensity class and yield measure - An indication of whether land-use intensity step is based on yield, in which case yield is considered to be linked to intensity rather than independent. For example the harvesting technique in forest (e.g. clear cut, selective logging) is used to define the land-use intensity class and also determines the amount of extracted yield.

Table 3 Overview of the five major stages of history land-use applied in the analysis. Numbers given in brackets are species richness/yield cases that fall within one of the land-use history classes.
