Study_Case	Name of study from which the data is taken	character				
Longitude	Longitude of study site	numeric	degree			
Latitude	Latitude of study site	numeric	degree			
LUI_range_level	Landuse intensity (classified according to table 1)	character				
Product	"Broad class of harvested product, i.e. crop, green fodder, and wood."	character				
main_climate	"Broad climate zone according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, i.e. polar, cold (continental), temperate, arid, and tropical."	character				
landuse_history	"Broad class of time of first significant use (table 3), i.e. 5950 BC, 50 BC, 1450, 1950, after 1950. And categorized according to the major developments of agriculture."	character				
LU_definition_and_ES	"An indication of whether land-use intensity step is based on yield, in which case yield is considered to be “linked” to intensity rather than “independent”. For example the harvesting technique in forest (e.g. clear cut, selective logging) is used to define the land-use intensity class and also determines the amount of extracted yield."	character
