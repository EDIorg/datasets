We conducted a Web of Science search engine (v. 5.32, 1982 to 18 May 2019) to find articles that reported day and night estimates of zooplankton density and biomass using the following topics:
(zooplankton dens* OR zooplankton bioma*) AND (night AND lake).
All articles from this search that had relevant paired entire water column zooplankton estimates were used in analyses. Data were extracted, if needed, from figures using WebPlotDigitizer (v4.2).

A second Web of Science search was conducted using a slightly different set of topic search terms to more comprehensively search the literature:
(zooplankton AND day AND night) AND (lake OR reservoir).
This second search was used to ascertain a robust search of relevant published articles. We also broadly searched older papers than the Web of Science timeframe for relevant data.
