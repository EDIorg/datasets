Zooplankton paired night and day density and biomass full water column estimates were derived from an extensive literature review to assess night and day differences in zooplankton population estimates. Data were collected from 48 published studies and 60 lakes and reservoirs for a total of 870 paired day-night zooplankton observations. Data were only included in analyses if samples were collected at least every 2 m from the surface to greater or equal to 80% of the station depth.
