In mid-May 1988, we established a transect 700 cm Ã— 20 cm through a stand of M. micrantha growing in an infrequently mown grassy sward on the Stony Brook university campus.  The transect completely crossed the stand. There were 413 individuals of M.  micrantha growing within the transect, and all were collected by cutting them at ground level as they were beginning to senesce. (However, this dataset contains data for only 206 individuals). The x and y coordinates of each plant were recorded. The plants were pressed and dried to constant weight at room temperature and then weighed to the nearest 0.001 g.
