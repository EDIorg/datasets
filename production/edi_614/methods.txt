All data was collected with a HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 64k Data Logger. The data loggers were kept in a pvc tube and placed within the stock tanks, and at the natural sites the loggers were similarly kept in a pvc tube and chained to a rock in the water. The loggers were retrieved/data was downloaded every.

The following lists the start, and if applicable, end dates for data collection at each site:
