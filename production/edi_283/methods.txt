The analytical approach blends an ecosystem process model (PROCESS) with the machine learning technology, recurrent neural networks (RNN). When combined, they are an implementation of TGDS that we term a process-guided recurrent neural network (PGRNN). PROCESS is a mass-balance model that tracks three different pools of phosphorus (P) within the lake system: epilimnetic P, hypolimnetic P, and sediment P. The RNN maps pattern in the response variable to a suite of driving variables as a "black box" model. PGRNN includes the output of PROCESS as an input to the neural network, unlike RNN, which uses only the observational data as an input. PGRNN weights the PROCESS predictions along with other drivers, allowing for the possibility of adjusting or eliminating PROCESS as a driver. PGRNN also includes the ecological principle of power scaling across the time domain in its loss function to constrain its predictions to ecologically reasonable values. The loss function penalizes PGRNN predictions when daily deviations exceed 80% of the deviations at the ~bi-weekly scale in the observed data and penalizes large discrepancies between the power spectra of the predicted and observed values. We fit all models to epilimnetic P concentration, which was sampled approximately monthly for 20 years. The observed time series was divided into six equal segments. Models were validated with one segment and were fit independently to the other five segments.
