We measured linear growth using the cranked wire method.  We set 30 cranked wires in each of the 21 study plots, with all wires placed in hummocks dominated by <emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis>.  Each year, from 2011 through 2015, we set cranked wires in May after the surface peat had thawed, and remeasured them at the end of the growing season (in late September or early October).
