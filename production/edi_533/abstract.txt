Ecologists working with a range of organisms and environments have carried out manipulative field experiments that enable us to ask questions about the interaction between competition and predation (including herbivory) and about the relative strength of competition and predation in the field. Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Therefore, this dataset was created by combining the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments on the interaction between competition and predation. These experiments tested whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects. The combined data was then analyzed using a factorial meta-analysis technique, the results of which were published in the study titled The Interaction between Competition and Predation: A Meta‚Äêanalysis of Field Experiments (Gurevitch et al., 2000).
