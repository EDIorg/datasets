We performed a whole-stream addition of a <superscript>13</superscript>C-DOC tracer and made laboratory measurements of the biological availability of the tracer as well as stream water DOC. The study was performed in October 2002 in a 1.27 km stretch of the third-order White Clay Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania. The tracer was prepared as a cold-water leachate of <superscript>13</superscript>C-labeled tulip poplar saplings and it was added to the stream along with sodium bromide, a conservative tracer, over a 2-h period.  Stream water samples were collected at 8 downstream stations over an 8-h period, filtered, and analyzed for concentrations of bromide and DOC. DOC was measured by Pt-catalyzed, persulfate oxidation, Br- was analyzed by ion chromatography, and C isotope samples were rotary evaporated, acidified, lyophilized, combusted, and the CO<subscript>2</subscript> analyzed with an elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Lability profiling of the <superscript>13</superscript>C-DOC tracer and stream water DOC were performed with a series of plug-flow bioreactors of increasing empty-bed contact times with the concentration of biodegradable DOC operationally defined as the difference between the DOC concentrations in the influent and effluent waters of the bioreactors. The bioreactor measurements were performed 2 days after the whole-stream release. Data were analyzed to estimate the uptake of stream water DOC associated with labile and semi-labile fraction of biodegradable DOC.
