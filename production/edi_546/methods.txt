We selected five exotic woody species that are common invaders in Long Island forests. Each invasive species was paired with a closely related (either congeneric or con-familial) native species of similar growth form whenever possible (Table 1). Autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) does not have any native congeneric or con-familial relatives on Long Island; nevertheless, we felt it was important to include it in our experiment, as it is an abundant invader in our region and in many areas of the Eastern United States. In lieu of a congeneric or con-familial native species, we paired E. umbellata with New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), a native plant in the same order (Rhamnales) with a similar growth form and similar ability to fix nitrogen. All native species used in these experiments are either common on Long Island or were historically common. Experiments were located in six field sites, three in the pine barrens (Sarnoff Preserve, 40degree53.212'N 72degree38.694'W, Eastport, 40degree51.136'N 72degree43.929'W, and Brookhaven National Laboratory pine barrens, 40degree52.52'N 72degree51.66'W), and three in mixed-hardwood forests (East Farm, 40degree54.331'N 73degree09.104'W, Weld Preserve, 40degree54.510'N 73degree12.631'W, and Brookhaven National Laboratory hard-wood site, 40degree52.33'N 72degree51.67'W). In each location, experiments were situated just interior to the forest canopy, along the edge of forest gaps that we created in 1996 (four sites) or along forest edges (two Brookhaven sites). Experiments were set up along the edges of these gaps because this is the usual invasion frontier from which forests become invaded by exotic species. Plants were grown both with and without protection from deer and rabbits, but invertebrates were not excluded. We monitored leaf loss of all plants throughout the experiment and measured final dry biomass at the end of the study. Plants were grown in five 2.4 m x 1.2 m blocks at each site, with each block divided into two equal-sized plots, and each plot further divided into two subplots. One plot in each block was fenced with 4-ft tall wire mesh to exclude large vertebrate herbivores, and the other plot was left open. Nitrogen was added to two 1.2 m x 0.6 m subplots in each block, one inside the wire exclosure and one outside the exclosure, as 31.24 g of sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 16% N; A.H. Hoffman, Inc., Lancaster, NY) and 23.80 g of ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4, 21% N; Espoma, Millville, NJ] dissolved in 1 liter of deionized water using a portable backpack sprayer on May 26, 2004 (corresponding to an application rate of 14 g of N/m2/yr). One liter of deionized water was added to each control subplot. One individual of each of the 10 plant species (Table 1) was planted into each subplot, for a total of 40 plants per block and 200 plants per site. Plants were grown from seeds purchased from Sheffield's Seed Company, Inc. (Locke, New York). Seeds were cold stratified in the refrigerator for between 1 and 3 months, depending on the species (stratification was timed so that all seeds would be ready to plant at the same time), and planted in the greenhouse in March 2004. Seeds germinated and grew in the greenhouse for approximately 2 months. Acer platanoides had poor germination, so recently emerged A. platanoides seedlings (with cotyledons) were collected locally and transplanted into the experiment. All seedlings were transplanted into the field on June 1 and 2, 2004, after recording initial leaf number and leaf length of the youngest fully expanded leaf. Seedlings were watered twice during the first week in the field, and then received no supplemental water, as summer rainfall was adequate for growth. To track damage throughout the experiment, the number of leaves on each plant was recorded on June 23, July 14, July 28, and August 17–18. We noted whether the damage to the plants could be directly attributed to herbivores (chew or bite marks on remnant vegetation), or to damage from an unknown source (i.e., torn leaves, stems with no petiole remaining, etc.). Above and below-ground biomass of live plants was harvested on August 17–18. Tissue was dried at 60degreeC, and roots and shoots were weighed and ground together. Nitrogen content of ground biomass samples was determined using a CE Flash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer (CE Instruments, Milan, Italy). Relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated as the natural log of final weight minus the natural log of initial weight. We estimated the original biomass of each seedling based on regressions for leaf number and length. Regression equations were calculated for each species, based on the relationship between the initial number of leaves, multiplied by the length of the youngest fully expanded leaf, and the dry weight of shoot and root tissue for 20 randomly selected seedlings of each species destructively harvested at the beginning of the experiment. R2 values for regression equations varied between 0.15 and 0.64, with a mean of 0.46 (0.05 SE). The R2 values were highly significant predictors of final plant size in analyses and thus were felt to produce robust relative estimates of growth rates.
