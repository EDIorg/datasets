Site	Identifies at which of the 8 corridor project experimental sites the date were collected	categorical				
Patch	"Identifies in which of the five patches per site the data were collected. Patches are lettered A, B, C, D, and E with A being the center patch, B being the connected patch, and C, D, and E labeling patches clockwise from Patch B"	categorical				
Shape	Identifies the patch as one of three possible shapes.	categorical				
Location	Identifies location of each plant within the patch based on which corner (corners labeled 1-4 and correspond to focal species plot corner descriptions) and distance from corner of patch (distances are labeled with a or b with a being the distance closest to the edge of the patch and b being the distance farthest from the edge and close to the center).	categorical				
Distance	Identifies the location of the plant within the patch as either being close to the corner or the center of the patch	categorical				
Leaf	Identifies from which of five leaves of each plant data were collected.	categorical				
Data	"Identifies which type of data were recorded. Disease and herbivory were often measured on the same plant. For all four rounds (see next 4 columns), data were collected differently bases on contents of the ""Data"" column. For leaves labeled ""Dead"": D = Dead, Numerical value of 0-100 identifies what percent area of that leaf was dead/dry. For plants labeled ""Disease"": N/A = data not taken most likely because leaf was dead or dying. M = leaf may be infected with disease but unable to be certain. N = leaf was not infected with target disease during this round of sampling. 1 = 1 or 2 small spots of target disease on leaf. 2 = 3-10 small spots of target disease on leaf. 3 = more than 10 spots of target disease on leaf. For plants labeled ""Herbivory"": 1 = < 1 percent of leaf eaten, 2 = 1-10 percent of leaf eaten, 3 = 10-50 percent of leaf eaten, 4 = >50 percent of leaf eaten"	categorical				
Round_1	Data that were recorded during the first round of sampling 14-19 days after plants were placed in the field	character				
Round_2	Data that were recorded during the second round of sampling 26-27 days after plants were placed in the field	character				
Round_3	Data that were recorded during the third round of sampling 33-36 days after plants were placed in the field	character				
Round_4	Data that were recorded during the fourth round of sampling 47-49 days after plants were placed in the field	character
