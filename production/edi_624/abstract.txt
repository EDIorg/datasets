Lake surface temperatures are steadily increasing. DO responds to temperature through multiple mechanisms, suggesting that DO in lakes should be responding to changing water temperatures. To determine whether and how DO is changing in temperate lakes, we collected and analyzed 22,983 temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles from approximately 400 mostly temperate zone lakes. Here, we present resulting derived statistics from this analysis. These statistics include mean summer epilimnetic temperature and DO, hypolimnetic temperature and DO, Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, as well as select meteorological variables such as mean summer air temperature and wind speed.
