This dataset is used in the analysis published in the following manuscript: Klug, J.L., D.C. Richardson, H.A. Ewing, B.R.Hargreaves, N. R. Samal, D. Vachon, D.C. Pierson, A. E. Lindsey, D. O'Donnell, S.W. Effler, and K.C. Weathers. 2012. Ecosystem effects of a tropical cyclone on a network of lakes in northeastern North America. Environmental Science and Technology 46(21): 11693â€“11701.  We include Quality Assurance Quality Controlled (QAQC) high-frequency dissolved oxygen, wind speed, and water temperature data from nine lakes and reservoirs in northeastern North America which were near the track of Tropical Cyclone Irene in August 2011. These data were collected using a set of in situ, automated monitoring systems associated with the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) that record data at high frequency (10 min to 6 h). These sensor data were the basis for the derived measures of Schmidt stability, net ecosystem production, respiration, and gross primary production included in the dataset. We also include daily rainfall data collected at on-site or nearby weather stations. All data cover the period from 01 August through 15 October 2011.
