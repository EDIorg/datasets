In September 2013-2015, we measured annual leader extension of <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis> on four trees (0.5-2.5 m tall) per plot.  To convert leader extension to tree production, we used the allometric equation for <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis> growth in an Alberta bog developed by Munir et al. (2015): growth (kg tree<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>) = 0.0085 x (leader extension, cm yr<superscript>-1</superscript>)<superscript>2.2088</superscript>.  Across a post-fire bog chronosequence in Alberta, on average, 22% of bog <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> aboveground biomass was contributed by needles (Wieder et al. 2009).  Density of <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> trees is variable both within and between Alberta bogs, ranging from less than 1 to over 37 trees m<superscript>-2</superscript> (> 0.4 cm diam.) (Wieder et al. 2009).  Using a visually estimated <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> density at Mariana Lakes Bog of 1 tree m<superscript>-2</superscript>, and N concentrations in <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> needles, we calculated annual N assimilation attributable to new needle production.
