Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>; regional background levels <2 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>.  Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition.  To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH<subscript>4</subscript>NO<subscript>3</subscript>) to a bog near Mariana Lakes, Alberta, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N ha<superscript>-1</superscript> yr<superscript>-1</superscript>, plus controls (no water or N addition). In September 2013-2015, we measured annual leader extension of <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis> on four trees (0.5-2.5 m tall) per plot.  Using a visually estimated <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> density at Mariana Lakes Bog of 1 tree m<superscript>-2</superscript>, and N concentrations in <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> needles, we calculated annual N assimilation attributable to new needle production. Annual leader extension and tree growth increased with increasing N input, with the response becoming more pronounced from 2013 through 2015.  <emphasis>Picea mariana</emphasis> needle N concentrations also increased with increasing N input, at a modest, but significant rate that was consistent across all years while water addition alone had no significant effect on <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> leader extension, growth, needle N concentration, or N assimilation in any of the years of measurement (p >= 0.54). At Mariana Lakes Bog, the effect of N addition on <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> NPP became more pronounced over time.  We cannot determine the extent to which the progressively steeper <emphasis>P. mariana</emphasis> growth response to N deposition represents a cumulative effect of added N or is related to interannual differences in temporal climatic variables.
