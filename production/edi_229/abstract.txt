To test how climate warming and variation in soil moisture supply will jointly influence photosynthesis of southern boreal forest tree species we measured gas exchange rates of 11 species in an open-air warming experiment at two sites in northern Minnesota, USA. The experiment ran for three years and used juveniles of 11 temperate and boreal tree species under ambient and seasonally warmed (+3.4 degC above- and belowground) conditions.  We measured in situ light-saturated net photosynthesis (Anet) and leaf diffusive conductance (gs) on numerous days across the three growing seasons. Soil and plant temperatures and soil moisture were continuously measured from sensor arrays.
