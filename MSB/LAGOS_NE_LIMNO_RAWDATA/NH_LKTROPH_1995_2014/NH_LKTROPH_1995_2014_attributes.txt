WATERBODY_ID			character	If a station is surface water based then the ID of the waterbody it resides on will be displayed. This ID is assigned to the waterbody by the NHDES Watershed Management Bureau. These IDs are the same as those used for assessment purposes and are based on the 1:100000 digital line graph dataset. In some cases a waterbody ID can encompass more than one stream in an area if the water quality and other parameters are similar for all river segments.

HUC12		dimensionless	real		The 12 digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) the station resides in. Major river basins are divided into smaller hydrogeographic regions based upon a coding system developed by the United States Geological Survey and adopted by the State of New Hampshire. This numbering scheme is called the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). Each Hydrologic Unit is further divided into smaller sections which we call the watershed and each watershed is assigned a 3-digit code. This makes the numeric watershed identifier a rather lengthy number but useful for cataloguing and communicating electronic information. However for the sake of recognition and dialog the watersheds are also referred to by name usually by a significant waterbody within the watershed.	numeric

DEPTH		dimensionless	real		Depth in the water column the sample was taken at. Some observations do not have any depth info.

Almost always that means it was a surface water sample but we don’t assume that in our database so it’s left blank. Sometimes the depth will be entered as parameter/substance or in the comments but not always.”	numeric
