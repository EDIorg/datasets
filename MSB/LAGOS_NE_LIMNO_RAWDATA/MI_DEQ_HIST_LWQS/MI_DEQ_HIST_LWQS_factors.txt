Remark_Code	K	Off-scale low. Actual value not known but known to be less than value shown
Remark_Code	C	Calculated. Value stored was not measured directly but was calculated from other data available.
Remark_Code	D	Field measurement. Some parameter codes (e.g. 401 Field pH) imply this condition without this remark).
Remark_Code	T	Value reported is less than the criteria of detection.
Remark_Code	W	Value observed is less than the lowest value reportable under remark T
Remark_Code	L	Off-scale high. Actual value not known but known to be greater than value shown.
Remark_Code	Q	Sample held beyond normal holding time.
Remark_Code	J	Estimated. Value shown is not a result of analytical measurement.
Remark_Code	A	Value reported is the mean of two or more determinations
Composite_Method_Code	B	Samples are not collected continuously or as a grap. STORET used this code for replicate samples
Composite_Method_Code	C	Samples collected continuously
Composite_Method_Code	G	Samples collected as a grab. The number comprising the sample may or may not be reported. If the number comrising the sample is reported the number will be stored in the composite grap number column of the sample table
