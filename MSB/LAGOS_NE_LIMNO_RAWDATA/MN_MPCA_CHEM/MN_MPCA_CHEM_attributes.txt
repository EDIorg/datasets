SAMPLE_UPPER_DEPTH		meter	whole		Upper depth at which sample was collected Surface grab samples have an upper depth of 0 and no lower depth (blank) If no lower depth reported, then samples were collected as discrete samples at the depth listed	numeric		
SAMPLE_LOWER_DEPTH		meter	real		Lower depth at which sample was collected Integrated water column samples have an upper and lower depth According to current SOP, nutrient, chlorophyll, and algae samples are collected as integrated samples (0-2 m) for lakes that are 2 m or deeper and as surface samples (bottle in hand) for lakes shallower than 2 m with an additional discrete “depth sample” (Kemmerer) collected on lakes greater than 5 m deep	numeric

Suspended: That portion of the analyte which is suspended in the sampled medium, either as, or adsorbed to, particles which are more or less uniformly dispersed within the medium. Total Recoverable [Tot Rcvrbl] Total: The total of all fractions of the analyte.	Sample of fraction being analyzed Dissolved: That portion of the analyte found in the liquid medium.
