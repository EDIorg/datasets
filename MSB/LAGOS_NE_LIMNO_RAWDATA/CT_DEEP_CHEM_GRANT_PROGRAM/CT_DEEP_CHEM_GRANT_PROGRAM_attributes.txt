Sampling_Location			character	Deep hole - deep part of the lake Middle hole - Some studies reported the sample location as the middle of the lake and because bathymetry could not be determined If multiple deep holes were reported and sampled from each hole was given a unique number or a unique descriptive name (e.g. “deep hole 2” or “deep hole near dam”). If the location of the sample was unknown the sample site with the deepest sample depth was chosen and called “deepest sampling location”. If no information regarding sample location was given the sampling location is “unknown”.
