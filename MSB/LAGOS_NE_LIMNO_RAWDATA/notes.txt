datasets with issues:
=====================

See Patricia's email dated Mar 28. Are the listed variables the exclusive set that should be in these data tables? If the processing scripts extract these variables then is there really an issue here?


Unprocessed, with knowns solutions
==================================
NH_LKTROPH_1995_2014 - Convert from long to wide format (metadata reflects the long format, but for sake of preventing information loss, convert to wide).
NH_VLAP - Convert from long to wide format (metadata reflects the long format, but for sake of preventing information loss, convert to wide).
NH_VLAP_1995_20140 - Convert from long to wide format (metadata reflects the long format, but for sake of preventing information loss, convert to wide).
WI_BIOCOM - Create single .xml out of 4, which includes the 4 data tables.
WI_CROSS_LAKE - Create single .xml, which includes the 3 data tables.



Convert from long to wide format
--------------------------------
CT_DEEP_CHEM
IL_ALMP_SPRNGFLD_2004_2006
MA_DEP_2005_2010
MN_SENTINEL
NH_LKTROPH
VT_DWQ_NUTRIENT
WI_LDF_CHEM


Data table in pieces
--------------------
ME_DEP_CHEM
MN_GPR_CHEM
OH_MIAMI_CHEM (DELETE VARIABLES FROM THE EML THAT ARE NOT IN THE DATA TABLE)
MN_MPCA_CHEM_1999_2012
MN_FDL_chemistry - Additionally, convert from long to wide format.


Type 1. More attributes listed in .xml than in table. Add missing attributes to table or delete excessive attributes from .xml.
-------------------------------------------------
EPA_TIME_CHEM (The wrong excel file was in this folder, I have replaced it with the correct one: DataImport_EPA_TIME_CHEM.xlsx)
CT_DEEP_SECCHI
NH_SUNAPEE
NY_SENECA
NY_ADIRONDACK_1984 - This data table also has columns that are not listed in the .xml.
IN_chemistry - Lacking .R code. (THIS FILE WAS NOT PROCESSED IN R; WE PROCESSED USING SQL AND DO NOT HAVE THE CODE)


Type 3. Data table has more columns than described in the .xml. Remove these columns from the table or add send attribute information.
--------------------------------------------------------------
EPA_ELS_PHASE_I
MA_DEP_CHEM
PA_DEP_CHEM
WI_DNR_NUTRIENT
WI_FCPC_CHEM
WI_POSITION_CHEM
WI_L_POSITION_CHL
PA_WALLENPAUPACK_CHEM - Additionally data table is in pieces.

Lacking .R code for these datasets.
----------------------------------
