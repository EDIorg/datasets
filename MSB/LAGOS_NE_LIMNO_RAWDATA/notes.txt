EML data table attributes
=========================
When character strings are present in otherwise numeric column. Attributes are defined as numeric so units will show in EML.

problematic datasets
====================

Definitions:
------------
Type 1. Data table does not include all attributes listed in .xml (these are highlighted yellow in datasetname_attributes_draft.xlsx files).
Type 2. .xml includes attributes not listed in the data table.
Type 3. Data table has more column names than described in .xml.
